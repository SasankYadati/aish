Natural Language Description: list open files
LLM's completion: lsof -i :80
Expert's completion: lsof
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `lsof -i :80` incorrectly restricts the command to listing files associated with network connections on port 80. The expert's completion `lsof` correctly lists all open files, which is consistent with the given natural language description 'list open files.'"
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: create a directory /testbed/test_dir
LLM's completion: mkdir -p /testbed/test_dir
Expert's completion: mkdir /testbed/test_dir
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion `mkdir -p /testbed/test_dir` is faithful to the task as it creates the directory `/testbed/test_dir` just like the expert's completion. The `-p` flag ensures that any parent directories are also created if they don't exist, which is an enhancement but still fulfills the original task requirement."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the current date and time
LLM's completion: date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
Expert's completion: date
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion \'date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"\' is a faithful execution of the task because it prints the current date and time in a specific format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. The expert\'s completion \'date\' also correctly prints the current date and time, though it uses the default format determined by the system. Both approaches fulfill the task, but the LLM\'s response provides a formatted output.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: remove a directory named fake_dir
LLM's completion: rm -rf fake_dir
Expert's completion: rmdir fake_dir
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's command `rm -rf fake_dir` is not faithful to the task because it forcefully removes the directory, including all its contents, without confirmation. The task only specifies removing a directory named `fake_dir`, which implies it should be empty. The expert's solution, `rmdir fake_dir`, correctly removes an empty directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print environment variables
LLM's completion: printenv | sort
Expert's completion: env
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion using `printenv | sort` correctly prints environment variables, albeit with additional sorting. Both `env` and `printenv` display environment variables, so the primary functionality is faithful to the task, even if the exact method varies from the expert's translation."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the current user's home directory
LLM's completion: echo ~$USER
Expert's completion: echo $HOME
is_faithful=True explanation="Both commands effectively print the current user's home directory. The LLM's completion uses the tilde (~) notation, which is expanded by the shell to the home directory of the specified user (and defaults to the current user when used as ~ alone or with $USER). The expert's completion directly references the $HOME environment variable that stores the path to the home directory. Both are correct for the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the current user's path
LLM's completion: print $HOME
Expert's completion: echo $PATH
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful to the task. '$HOME' refers to the home directory path of the current user, whereas '$PATH' contains the list of directories used by the shell to look for executable programs, which is what was requested."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the contents of the setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh file
LLM's completion: cat /home/user/Downloads/setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: cat setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's translation is functionally correct as it uses the `cat` command to display the file contents. However, it specifies an absolute path (`/home/user/Downloads/`) which assumes a specific location, while the expert's completion assumes the current directory. If the file is actually located in the specified path, the LLM's completion would work; otherwise, it could be seen as less faithful due to the assumption about file location."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the first 5 lines of the setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh file
LLM's completion: nl2b_fs_1.sh|head -5
Expert's completion: head -n 5 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses a different filename, 'nl2b_fs_1.sh', instead of the correct file 'setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh' given in the description. It also incorrectly places the filename before the pipe, which is syntactically incorrect for the intended command."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the last 5 lines of the setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh file
LLM's completion: tail -5 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: tail -n 5 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion and the expert's completion use the `tail` command to display the last 5 lines of the file. The `-5` option in the LLM's version is an abbreviated form of `-n 5`, which is functionally equivalent and a valid alternative in this context. Therefore, the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the tenth line of the setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh: line 10: print
Expert's completion: sed -n 10p setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not correctly implement the task of printing the tenth line of the file. It seems to misinterpret the requirement by attempting to print an error-like message instead. The expert's completion correctly uses the 'sed' command to extract and print the tenth line from the file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the path of the bash executable
LLM's completion: BASH=/usr/bin/bash
Expert's completion: which bash
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `BASH=/usr/bin/bash` does not directly address the task of printing the path of the bash executable. It assigns a specific path to the variable BASH, whereas the task is to dynamically determine and print the path of the bash executable. The expert's completion `which bash` correctly finds and prints the current path of the bash executable using the `which` command."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system utilization stats
LLM's completion: vmstat 1
Expert's completion: vmstat
is_faithful=True explanation="Both commands, `vmstat` and `vmstat 1`, will provide system utilization stats. The `vmstat` command gives a one-time snapshot, whereas `vmstat 1` will continuously update the stats every second. The LLM's completion is faithful as it still addresses the task of printing system utilization stats."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system load averages
LLM's completion: uptime
Expert's completion: w
is_faithful=True explanation="Both `uptime` and `w` commands correctly display the system load averages. The `uptime` command is commonly used specifically for this purpose, while `w` provides more detailed information about who is logged in as well. Thus, the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print running processes
LLM's completion: ps aux
Expert's completion: ps
is_faithful=True explanation="Both `ps` and `ps aux` are valid commands for printing running processes. The `ps` command by itself provides a list of currently running processes for the current user session, while `ps aux` gives a more detailed, system-wide list, including all users. The LLM's completion is a faithful interpretation of the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print running processes in a tree format
LLM's completion: htop
Expert's completion: pstree
is_faithful=False explanation="The command 'htop' is a system-monitoring tool that provides an interface to view running processes, but it is not specifically used to display processes in a tree format. The correct command 'pstree' specifically shows running processes in a tree format, making it the faithful translation for the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system memory usage
LLM's completion: free -m
Expert's completion: free
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. Both `free` and `free -m` command print the system memory usage. The `-m` option in the LLM's completion represents the memory usage in megabytes, which is a reasonable interpretation unless a specific unit is required."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system hostname
LLM's completion: hostnamectl status
Expert's completion: hostname
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `hostnamectl status` gives more detailed information about the system's status rather than just printing the hostname. The expert's completion `hostname` specifically prints the hostname, making it more faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system IP address
LLM's completion: ip addr show
Expert's completion: hostname -I
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion `ip addr show` and the expert's completion `hostname -I` can be used to find the system's IP address. The `ip addr show` command provides a detailed list of network interfaces and IP addresses, whereas `hostname -I` outputs only the IP addresses. Thus, the LLM's completion is faithful as it can be used to achieve the same result."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the ip addresses of the system DNS servers
LLM's completion: resolvectl status | grep '^DNS' | cut -d '=' -f2-
Expert's completion: cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is a valid way to print the IP addresses of the system DNS servers by using 'resolvectl status' and filtering for lines starting with 'DNS'. It achieves the task in a manner consistent with the goal, similar to the expert's method using '/etc/resolv.conf'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the network interfaces
LLM's completion: ip link
Expert's completion: ifconfig
is_faithful=True explanation='Both `ip link` and `ifconfig` are valid commands to display network interfaces on Linux systems. `ip link` is part of the newer `iproute2` package and is often recommended over `ifconfig`, which is considered deprecated but still widely used.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the routing table
LLM's completion: ip route show
Expert's completion: route
is_faithful=True explanation="Both commands display the routing table. 'ip route show' is a modern and common command used to display the routing table in Linux environments. The 'route' command is an older command with similar functionality. 'ip route show' is considered more comprehensive and detailed."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: show the last logged in users
LLM's completion: last | head -1
Expert's completion: last
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion 'last | head -1' only shows the most recent logged-in user, while the expert's completion 'last' lists all recent logins. Therefore, the LLM's translation is not faithful as it does not fulfill the task of showing the last logged-in users."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the last logged in users and show the full user and domain names
LLM's completion: lastlog | awk '{print $1,$2,$3}'
Expert's completion: last -w
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `lastlog`, which shows the last login time per user, but doesn't display the full user and domain names. The expert's completion `last -w` displays recent logins including full user names and their details, as requested."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: base64 encode the string 'hello'
LLM's completion: base64 --decode <<< hello | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base64 --decode | base
Expert's completion: echo 'hello' | base64
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion wrongly decodes instead of encoding the string 'hello'. It also performs excessive and incorrect operations, whereas the expert's solution correctly encodes the string using 'echo' and 'base64'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: base64 decode the string 'aGVsbG8='
LLM's completion: base64 --decode 'aGVsbG8='
Expert's completion: echo 'aGVsbG8=' | base64 -d
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion and the expert's completion correctly decode the string 'aGVsbG8=' from base64. While the LLM uses a different syntax by directly passing the string as an argument to `base64 --decode`, the expert echoes the string and pipes it to `base64 -d`. Both methods are valid and achieve the same result."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print lines containing 'console' in the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: grep console setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: grep 'console' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion and the expert's completion both use the `grep` command to search for lines containing 'console' in the specified file. Both completions effectively achieve the same result, and the LLM's omission of quotes around 'console' doesn't alter the outcome, assuming no special characters or spaces in the search term."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list the stats and timestamps of the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: stat setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh; stat -c %x setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh; stat -c %y setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: stat setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion includes the command `stat setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh`, which matches the expert's solution and satisfies the requirement of listing the file's stats.\n\nAdditionally, the LLM explicitly retrieves individual timestamps (`%x` for access time and `%y` for modification time) using `stat -c` options, which provides detailed timestamps. This does not detract from the request and can be seen as offering more detailed information."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: gzip the file /testbed/hello.php keeping the original file
LLM's completion: gzip -c /testbed/hello.php > /testbed/hello.php.gz
Expert's completion: gzip -k /testbed/hello.php
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'gzip -c' which outputs to stdout, and redirects it to '/testbed/hello.php.gz' to preserve the original. However, the '-k' option directly ensures the original is kept while compressing. The LLM's output is not straightforward, requiring additional steps not specified in the description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list background jobs
LLM's completion: jobs -l
Expert's completion: jobs
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion (jobs -l) is faithful to the task because it lists background jobs and includes additional information, such as the PID and job ID, which enhances the output without deviating from the core requirement of listing background jobs."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the current process priority
LLM's completion: ps -o pid,ppid,ni,sz,%mem,%cpu,cmd -p 1234
Expert's completion: nice
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion tries to retrieve process information using `ps`, which does not directly display the current process's priority. It includes various process attributes that aren't necessary. The expert's completion uses the `nice` command, which directly relates to process priority, making it the faithful translation."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the pid of the current shell
LLM's completion: echo $BASHPID
Expert's completion: echo $$
is_faithful=False explanation="The expert's completion using `echo $$` correctly displays the PID of the current shell. The LLM's completion `echo $BASHPID` displays the PID of the current bash process, which in most cases is similar, but specifically tracks subshells and functions, not necessarily the login shell. Therefore, it's not always identical, making the LLM's completion not fully faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the current user's groups
LLM's completion: groups ${UID}
Expert's completion: groups
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion "groups ${UID}" attempts to get the groups of the user by using the UID variable, which is incorrect. The command to list the current user\'s groups is simply "groups". Therefore, the LLM\'s completion is not faithful to the task as it adds unnecessary complexity and may not work as intended.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the current user's id
LLM's completion: id -u $USER
Expert's completion: id
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion `id -u $USER` specifically retrieves the current user's ID by using the `-u` option to return only the user ID. Although the expert's completion `id` also provides the current user's ID along with additional information, the LLM's completion is faithful as it achieves the main task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list memory information
LLM's completion: free -m
Expert's completion: lsmem
is_faithful=False explanation="The natural language description 'list memory information' suggests displaying detailed information about the memory. The expert's completion 'lsmem' provides a detailed list of memory information, including details about memory blocks, whereas the LLM's completion 'free -m' shows a summary of memory usage in megabytes, focusing more on available, used, and free memory. The LLM's completion captures a different aspect of memory information and thus is not fully faithful to the original request."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the installed ssh version
LLM's completion: ssh -v | grep Protocol
Expert's completion: ssh -V
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'ssh -v' and pipes it to 'grep Protocol', which checks the protocol version rather than the installed version of ssh. The command 'ssh -V' is appropriate as it directly reports the installed version of 'ssh'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the bash profile in the home directory
LLM's completion: cat ~/.bash_profile
Expert's completion: cat ~/.bashrc
is_faithful=True explanation="Both translations attempt to display a bash profile file from the home directory. The term 'bash profile' commonly refers to files that configure the shell session. In many systems, `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.bashrc` serve this purpose, though they are different files with slightly different roles. `~/.bash_profile` is specifically for login shells, while `~/.bashrc` is for non-login shells. The LLM's translation is acceptable given the ambiguity in the description, as both files are related to bash profiles and are located in the home directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system's locale
LLM's completion: locale -a
Expert's completion: locale
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion with `locale -a` lists all available locales on the system. The expert's completion with `locale` prints the current system's locale settings. Therefore, the LLM's completion does not faithfully execute the natural language instruction to specifically print the system's current locale settings."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list block devices
LLM's completion: lsblk -d
Expert's completion: lsblk
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion `lsblk -d` lists block devices, omitting partitions, while the Expert's `lsblk` lists all block devices including partitions. Both commands fulfill the core task of listing block devices, so the LLM's completion can be considered faithful to the task, though it provides a slightly more specific result."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: find all files larger than 100MB in the current dir
LLM's completion: find. -size +100M
Expert's completion: find . -size +100M -print
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is almost correct in finding files larger than 100MB. While it does not explicitly include `-print`, the `-print` action is the default behavior when no action is specified. Therefore, it is still faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: count the lines, words, and characters in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: wc -l setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: wc setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion incorrectly repeats the filename three times and counts only lines. The expert's command `wc setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh` correctly counts lines, words, and characters in the file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the lines in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh sorted alphabetically
LLM's completion: sort setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | sort -f
Expert's completion: sort setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM adds an unnecessary second `sort -f` command, which is redundant and not mentioned in the description.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the unique lines in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: grep -v -E '^ *$' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | sort -u | grep -v -E '^ *$'
Expert's completion: uniq setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `sort -u` with `grep` to filter out empty lines, which is not needed to achieve the task. The task is simply to print unique lines, which the `uniq` command directly handles after sorting. However, the expert's completion is incorrect too because it doesn't sort the file before using `uniq`, which is necessary to ensure all duplicates are adjacent. A more faithful approach would be `sort setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | uniq`. The LLM's approach is more complex and deviates from directly achieving the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display network statistics
LLM's completion: netstat -e
Expert's completion: netstat --statistics
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion, `netstat -e`, displays Ethernet statistics specifically, not overall network statistics. The expert's completion, `netstat --statistics`, provides a more comprehensive view of network statistics, which is faithful to the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display network interfaces
LLM's completion: ip link
Expert's completion: netstat -i
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `ip link` lists network interfaces and their details, which is faithful to the task of displaying network interfaces. However, the expert's completion using `netstat -i` also displays the network interfaces. Both commands achieve the same goal, although the approaches are different. The LLM’s completion is technically correct and serves the purpose of displaying network interfaces; however, the specific request may suggest the use of traditional tools like `netstat`. The LLM’s choice of `ip link` is a modern equivalent and still faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display a calendar for the next 3 months
LLM's completion: onacal 3
Expert's completion: cal -3
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion 'onacal 3' is incorrect. There is no such command 'onacal' in bash for displaying calendars. The correct command should be 'cal -3', which correctly displays the calendar for the current month along with the previous and next two months."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: show running daemons and services
LLM's completion: systemctl --type=notify --state=running
Expert's completion: service --status-all
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `systemctl --type=notify --state=running` is not faithful. It is specifically filtering for services of type 'notify' in 'running' state, which does not enumerate all running daemons. The expert's completion `service --status-all` is more aligned with the natural language description as it lists all services and their statuses, effectively showing running daemons and services."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system boot time
LLM's completion: cat /proc/stat | grep boot_time
Expert's completion: who -b
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion using `cat /proc/stat | grep boot_time` attempts to find the boot time, but `boot_time` doesn't exist in `/proc/stat`. Instead, the boot time can typically be found using `who -b`, which shows the last boot time. Therefore, the LLM's command is not faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print current swap usage
LLM's completion: free -m | awk 'NR==2{print $7}'
Expert's completion: swapon --show
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `free` command with `awk` to extract data from the wrong line (it uses line 2, which is for memory), not the swap usage line. The expert uses `swapon --show`, which directly shows swap usage, making the expert's version accurately reflect the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print a list of active kernel parameters
LLM's completion: cat /proc/sys/kernel/panic
Expert's completion: sysctl -a
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion, `cat /proc/sys/kernel/panic`, retrieves a specific kernel parameter (panic), not a list of all active kernel parameters. The expert's completion, `sysctl -a`, correctly lists all active kernel parameters. Therefore, the LLM's completion is not faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list the installed software packages
LLM's completion: dpkg --list
Expert's completion: dpkg --get-selections
is_faithful=True explanation="Both `dpkg --list` and `dpkg --get-selections` can be used to list software packages installed on a Debian-based system. \n\n- `dpkg --list` provides a detailed view including the package name, version, and architecture.\n- `dpkg --get-selections` shows a simpler list that includes package names and installation states.\n\nThe LLM's completion is a faithful translation, as it achieves the task of listing installed software packages."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list available shells
LLM's completion: shopt -q -o list_aliases list_types list_functions list_jobs list_expands list_aliases list_types list_functions list_jobs list_expands list_aliases list_types list_functions list_jobs list_expands list_aliases list_types list_functions list_jobs list_expands list_aliases list_types list_functions list_jobs list_expands list_aliases list_types list_functions list_jobs list_expands list_aliases list_types list_functions list_jobs list_expands list_aliases list_types list_functions list_jobs list_expands list_aliases list_types list_functions list_jobs list_expands list_aliases list_types list_functions list_jobs list_expands list_aliases list_types list_functions list_jobs list_expands list
Expert's completion: cat /etc/shells
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not address the task of listing available shells. Instead, it contains repetitive and incorrect options for the `shopt` command, which is unrelated to listing shells. The expert's completion correctly uses `cat /etc/shells` to show the available shells on the system."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list all users on the system
LLM's completion: id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -u <user> || id -
Expert's completion: getent passwd
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the 'id' command incorrectly with repetitive and nonsensical syntax. It does not achieve the task of listing all users on the system. On the other hand, the expert's solution 'getent passwd' correctly retrieves the user list from the system database."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: extract the filename from this path '/usr/local/bin/my_script.sh'
LLM's completion: echo '/usr/local/bin/my_script.sh' | cut -d/ -f5
Expert's completion: basename /usr/local/bin/my_script.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `cut` to extract the 5th field, assuming fields are separated by slashes. This approach can break if the number of path segments changes. The expert's `basename` solution is more robust as it directly extracts the filename from the path."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: send the message 'System maintenance in 10 minutes!' to all logged in users
LLM's completion: wall "System maintenance in 10 minutes!"
Expert's completion: wall 'System maintenance in 10 minutes!'
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the correct `wall` command to broadcast a message to all logged-in users, which aligns with the task requirement. The choice between single or double quotes does not affect the functionality in this context, making it faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the file type of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: sh setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to execute the script with `sh`, which is not the correct way to print the file type. The expert's completion uses the `file` command, which is the correct approach to determine and display the file type of `setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh`."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the contents of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh with lines wrapped to 40 characters
LLM's completion: cat -s setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: fold -w 40 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `cat` with the `-s` option, which suppresses repeated empty output lines but does not wrap text to any specific width. It does not achieve the task of wrapping lines to 40 characters. The expert's completion correctly uses `fold -w 40` to wrap lines at 40 characters."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print all system configuration variables
LLM's completion: printenv | sort
Expert's completion: getconf -a
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `printenv | sort`, which lists sorted environment variables, not system configuration variables. The correct command for system configuration variables is `getconf -a`. Thus, the LLM's completion is not faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the max cpu time
LLM's completion: gprof --flat-profile -s -y -c -p -L -P -S -D -L -l -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -L -
Expert's completion: ulimit -t
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `gprof` command with an incorrect set of options, which does not align with the task of printing the maximum CPU time. The expert's completion 'ulimit -t' is the correct command, as it accesses or modifies the CPU time limit for processes, which can be considered as the 'max' CPU time allowable for a process."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the configured size of long integers
LLM's completion: python -c "import sys; print(sys.maxsize)"
Expert's completion: getconf LONG_BIT
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion retrieves the maximum size of a Python integer, which is not the same as getting the configured bit size for long integers in the system. The expert's approach uses a system configuration command to get the bit size of long integers."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the number of times the word 'the' appears in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: wc -w setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | grep -o the | wc -l
Expert's completion: grep -o 'the' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion first counts all words in the file using `wc -w`, then attempts to use `grep -o the` on the result, which does not produce the correct number of occurrences of 'the'. The expert's completion correctly uses `grep -o 'the'` to directly find and count the instances of 'the' in the file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the number of files in the current directory
LLM's completion: ls | wc -l
Expert's completion: ls -a | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `ls | wc -l` will count only non-hidden files, whereas the expert's completion `ls -a | wc -l` will count all files, including hidden ones. Hence, the LLM's solution is not faithful to counting all files in the current directory as the expert intended, likely due to a difference in interpretation (i.e., whether hidden files should be included)."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print first line of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | head -1
Expert's completion: sed -n '1p' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is incorrect because it uses a non-existent command. The expert uses 'sed' which is correct for printing a specific line."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the last line of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: tail setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | head -n 1
Expert's completion: sed -n '$p' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `tail` to get the last line of the file, which is a valid interpretation of the task. However, the use of `head` with `tail` in that context is unnecessary. It still achieves the same result, as `tail` itself is designed to output the last lines. The expert's completion uses `sed`, which directly prints the last line. Both approaches are correct and faithful to the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print lines 3 to 5 of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | sed -n '3,5p'
Expert's completion: sed -n '3,5p' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to use the filename as a command, which results in an error. The expert's completion correctly uses 'sed' with the file as an argument."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print every other line of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: sed -n 1~2p setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: sed -n '1~2p' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses `sed -n 1~2p` to print every other line, which is equivalent to the expert's `sed -n '1~2p'`. Both versions accomplish the task as specified."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: find all empty files in the current directory, do not search sub directories
LLM's completion: find -maxdepth 1 -empty -type f
Expert's completion: find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -empty
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion accurately uses `find` with `-maxdepth 1` to ensure it only searches the current directory. It includes `-empty` to find empty files and `-type f` to specify regular files, which matches the intent of the description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print lines in the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh that are less than 20 characters
LLM's completion: setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | grep -E.\{1,20\}
Expert's completion: awk 'length < 40' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses an incorrect approach. The command is using `grep` and filters for lines that are up to 20 characters but includes the range operator, which does not work as intended with `grep`. Also, it is missing the `-v` option to exclude lines over 20 characters. The expert's completion correctly uses `awk` to select lines with fewer than 20 characters."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print lines in the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh that contain the characters 'the'
LLM's completion: egrep 'the' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: grep 'the' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion using `egrep` is faithful to the task, as `egrep` is an extended version of `grep` and performs the same operation for this particular pattern. Both `egrep 'the' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh` and `grep 'the' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh` will yield the same result in this context."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print lines in the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh that contain the characters 'the' and 'a'
LLM's completion: grep -E 'the.*a' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: grep 'the' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | grep 'a'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'grep -E' with a pattern that matches lines containing 'the' followed by 'a' in any order, which is incorrect. The expert's completion correctly finds lines containing both 'the' and 'a' independently, using a pipe to combine two grep commands."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the sha512 digest of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: sha512 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: sha512sum setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the command 'sha512', which is not standard in most bash environments. The correct command to display the sha512 digest is 'sha512sum', as shown in the expert's completion."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: encrypt the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh using the aes-256-cbc algorithm with password 'password' and save it to out.enc
LLM's completion: gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 --batch --yes --passphrase 'password' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh > out.enc
Expert's completion: openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh -pass pass:password -out out.enc
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `gpg` for encryption, which is not specified in the original task. The task requires using `openssl` with the `aes-256-cbc` algorithm. Instead, the LLM uses `gpg` with AES256, which, although similar, is a different tool and approach to encryption. The expert's completion correctly uses `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc` to fulfill the task requirements."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: create a file named 'world.txt' with the text 'hello' inside
LLM's completion: echo "hello" > world.txt
Expert's completion: echo 'hello' > world.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. Both the LLM and the expert solutions use similar commands to achieve the desired outcome. The use of double quotes instead of single quotes does not affect the functionality in this context."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system's public ip address
LLM's completion: dig +short myip.opendns.com
Expert's completion: curl ipinfo.io/ip
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not correctly fulfill the task. The command `dig +short myip.opendns.com` requires additional options or context to access the public IP address, unlike `dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com` which correctly does so. The expert's completion uses curl to fetch the IP from a web service, which directly shows the public IP address."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate a list of duplicate md5 sum hashes for all the ".java" files in the /testbed directory
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.java" -exec md5sum {} \; | sort | uniq -d
Expert's completion: md5sum /testbed/*.java | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -d
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `md5sum` directly on each file found with `find`, then attempts to find duplicate lines using `uniq -d`. However, `uniq -d` requires the list to be sorted by the key, which is not achieved because `md5sum` outputs both the hash and the filename. The `awk '{print $1}'` step in the expert's completion extracts only the md5 hashes before sorting and finding duplicates, which is necessary to identify duplicate hashes correctly. Thus, the LLM's output does not correctly calculate duplicate hashes, making it unfaithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of the md5 sum of all the files under /testbed/dir2/subdir2 sorted by filename
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir2/subdir2 -type f | sort | cut -d''-f1 | xargs md5sum | sort | cut -d''-f1 | xargs md5sum
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir2/subdir2 -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 md5sum | awk '{print $1}' | md5sum
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation is not faithful because it incorrectly uses commands and arguments to achieve the desired task. The use of `cut -d'' -f1` is incorrect as it doesn't properly extract the md5 hash. The `find` command isn't terminating file paths with null characters, and `xargs` isn't handling them safely without `-0`. Also, it sorts twice unnecessarily. The expert's version correctly handles null-terminated strings and extracts the hashes with `awk`."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of the contents of the sorted list of files "$FILES"
LLM's completion: sort -r "$FILES" | md5sum
Expert's completion: cat $(echo $FILES | tr ' ' '\n' | sort) | md5sum
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `sort -r` which sorts in reverse order, while the natural language task specifies sorting without reverse. Additionally, it sorts the file list itself, not the content of the files. The expert's completion correctly sorts the list of filenames, retrieves the contents of these files using `cat`, and then pipes the concatenated content into `md5sum`."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of the sorted list of md5 sums of all ".py" files under /testbed/dir1/subdir1
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir1/subdir1 -name "*.py" | sort | md5sum | md5sum
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir1/subdir1 -type f -name *.py -exec md5sum {} + | awk '{print $1}' | sort | md5sum
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` to list `.py` files and sorts their names, then attempts to get an md5 sum of this list and another md5 sum, which does not fulfill the task's requirements. It should calculate md5 sums for each file first, sort these sums, and then get the final md5 sum. This is correctly handled in the expert's completion."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the total disk usage for each ".txt" file on the /testbed directory and prepend the system host name to the output
LLM's completion: du -h --max-depth=1 /testbed/*.txt | sort -h | sed's/^/$(hostname)/ '
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.txt" -exec du {} + | awk -v hostname="$(hostname)" '{print hostname, $0}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to calculate disk usage for '.txt' files with 'du -h --max-depth=1 /testbed/*.txt', but this targets only the top level of the directory and assumes files present when using wildcards. It incorrectly uses 'sed' to prepend the hostname without space or proper syntax, leading to errors.\n\nThe expert's solution uses 'find' to locate all '.txt' files recursively within '/testbed', correctly ensuring every relevant file is processed. It then uses 'awk' to prepend the hostname, correctly implementing the task in one command without false assumptions."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Change permissions for all PHP files under the /testbed directory tree to 755 and print the number of files changed
LLM's completion: find /testbed -iname "*.php" -exec chmod 755 {} \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" -exec chmod 755 {} \; -exec /bin/echo {} \; | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion changes the permissions of all PHP files to 755, but it doesn't print the number of files changed. The expert's completion includes piping the result to `wc -l` to count and print the number of files changed."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Check if the current shell is running within a 'screen' process and print "True" or "False"
LLM's completion: screen -r 2>/dev/null || echo False
Expert's completion: pstree -s $$ | grep -q "screen" && echo "True" || echo "False"
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to reattach to a 'screen' session and outputs 'False' if unsuccessful. This doesn't verify if the current shell is within a 'screen' process. The expert's uses 'pstree' and 'grep' to check the process tree for 'screen', which accurately determines if the current shell is within a 'screen' process."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print "True" if the contents of file /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt is a subset of file /testbed/dir2/subdir1/textfile2.txt, otherwise print "False"
LLM's completion: cmp --silent /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt /testbed/dir2/subdir1/textfile2.txt
Expert's completion: comm -23 <(sort /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt | uniq) <(sort /testbed/dir2/subdir1/textfile2.txt | uniq) | head -1 | grep -q '.' && echo "False" || echo "True"
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `cmp --silent` to check if the files are identical, which is not the same as checking if one file is a subset of the other. The expert's completion sorts both files, removes duplicates, and uses `comm` to check for any lines in the first file that are not in the second file, thus correctly determining if the first file is a subset."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Compute the mean average of the word count of *.txt files in the /testbed directory
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -name "*.txt" -exec wc -w {} \; | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum/NR}' | awk '{print $1/2}'
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.txt' -print0 | xargs -0 wc -w | awk 'END { print $1/(NR-1) }'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion contains an extra awk command that divides the result by 2, which is not required. This results in an incorrect mean calculation."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Compute the mean average of the word count of *.txt files smaller than 6 words in the /testbed directory
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.txt' -size -6c | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum/NR}'
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.txt' -print0 | xargs -0 wc -w | awk '$1 < 6 {v += $1; c++} END {print v/c}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-size -6c` to find files smaller than 6 bytes, not word count. It does not compute the word count of each file and average them. The expert's completion uses `wc -w` to count words and correctly calculates the mean of files with fewer than 6 words."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Copy all files with "FooBar" in the path under the '/testbed' directory to the '/testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp' directory.
LLM's completion: cp /testbed/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??/??
Expert's completion: find /testbed -path '*FooBar*' -print0 | xargs -0 -I{} cp -r {} /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion does not attempt to find files with "FooBar" in the path as required, and instead provides an invalid directory template with placeholders for multiple unknown directories. The expert\'s completion uses the `find` command to search files with \'FooBar\' in the path and then copies them, which is a correct interpretation of the task.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for all .txt files in the /testbed directory, prints their paths, and then search within each file for the word "another"
LLM's completion: find /testbed -iname *.txt -print | xargs grep -i another
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.txt" \( -exec echo {} \; -o -exec true \; \) -exec grep another {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion is not faithful to the task. It uses `xargs grep -i another`, which will list files containing the word "another" but doesn\'t print the path of each .txt file before searching. The expert\'s completion explicitly prints each path before searching with `echo {}` and handles cases where some files might not contain the word."}'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Convert the first 16 characters in "/testbed/textfile7.txt" to a single hexadecimal value
LLM's completion: hexdump -n 16 -e '1/1 "%02x "' /testbed/textfile7.txt
Expert's completion: head /testbed/textfile7.txt -c16 | od -tx1 -w16 | head -n1 | cut -d' ' -f2- | tr -d ' '
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion `hexdump -n 16 -e \'1/1 "%02x "\' /testbed/textfile7.txt` generates a space-separated hexadecimal view of the first 16 bytes. In contrast, the expert\'s completion processes it into a single continuous hexadecimal string without spaces, which aligns with the task description. Therefore, the LLM\'s solution is not faithful.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Copies all files under the /testbed folder like "file.txt" with "FooBar" in the path to the root of the current folder, preserving mode, ownership and timestamp attributes.
LLM's completion: rsync -av --files-from=/testbed/file.txt --include=FooBar/ /testbed/.
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -path '*FooBar*' | xargs -i cp -p "{}" .
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'rsync' with '--files-from' on '/testbed/file.txt' and an 'include' filter that doesn't effectively select files with 'FooBar' in the path. It misunderstands the requirement to find and copy specific files. The expert’s solution correctly uses 'find' to locate files with 'FooBar' in their path and then copies them, preserving attributes, which aligns with the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Copy all files and folders below the /testbed directory whose names contain "FooBar" to directory '/testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp'
LLM's completion: cp /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp/*FooBar* /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp/
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*FooBar*' -print0 | xargs -0 -I{} cp -R {} /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to copy from /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp, rather than from paths in the /testbed directory matching *FooBar*. It also doesn't account for both files and folders matching 'FooBar' under /testbed."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count all the lines of all '*.c' files in /testbed directory recursively
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.c' | xargs wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.c" -print0 | xargs -0 cat | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses `find` to locate all the '*.c' files in the '/testbed' directory recursively and counts the lines using `wc -l`. It achieves the task described, although it may report the lines per file and a total, which still aligns with counting all the lines."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count all the lines of all files with names ending with 'php' in current directory and subdirectories recursively
LLM's completion: find. -name "*.php" -exec wc -l {} +
Expert's completion: find . -type f -name '*php' | xargs cat | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's solution uses `find` to locate all files ending with 'php' and executes `wc -l` on each of these files directly, which counts the number of lines per file and sums them up, providing the total line count. This approach is faithful to the task and achieves the same goal as the expert's completion, although through a slightly different method."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count all the lines of all php files in the /testbed directory recursively
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -name "*.php" | xargs wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed/ -name '*.php' | xargs cat | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's translations find all PHP files in the /testbed directory recursively and count the total number of lines. The LLM uses `wc -l` directly on the files, while the expert version concatenates all PHP files before counting the lines. Both approaches achieve the same end result. Therefore, the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5sum of all '*.py' files in /testbed folder and sub folders.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -iname '*.py' | md5sum
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -name "*.py" -exec md5sum {} +
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion pipes the list of '*.py' file paths into md5sum, resulting in a checksum of the path string itself, not the file contents. The expert's completion correctly computes the md5sum for the contents of each file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the *.html files residing in the /testbed directory tree and containing string "foo"
LLM's completion: find /testbed -iname *.html | grep -c foo
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.html" | xargs grep -l foo | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion counts the occurrences of "foo" in the overall output of the \'find\' command, rather than counting the number of *.html files that contain "foo". It uses \'grep -c\' which counts matches found in the input lines from the previous command. The expert\'s solution correctly finds and counts the number of distinct .html files containing the specific string "foo" by using \'grep -l\' and \'xargs\' to pass file names to \'grep\', then counting them with \'wc -l\'.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of files/directories with '.php' extension under /testbed directory tree and change the permissions to 755
LLM's completion: find /testbed -iname *.php | wc -l && find /testbed -iname *.php | xargs chmod 755
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" -exec chmod 755 {} \; -exec /bin/echo {} \; | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is almost correct but has a slight issue:\n\n1. It uses `-iname *.php` without quotes, which may cause incorrect matches or errors due to shell expansion.\n2. It separates counting and changing permissions using `&&`, which runs two separate `find` commands instead of using `-exec` to combine actions, potentially leading to different results if files are added or removed between commands.\n\nThe expert's solution effectively combines the permission change and counting by listing each file after changing its permissions."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of lines in all files in the /testbed directory tree that match pattern '*file*'
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*file*' | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed/ -name '*file*' | sort | xargs wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion counts the number of files matching the pattern. It does not count the number of lines in those files, which is what the task requires. The expert's completion correctly counts the lines in files that match the pattern."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of regular files in directory tree ${DIRECTORY} that contain a vowel in their names
LLM's completion: find ${DIRECTORY} -type f -name '*[aeiou]*' | wc -l
Expert's completion: find ${DIRECTORY} -type f -print | sed -e 's@^.*/@@' | grep '[aeiouyAEIOUY]' | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion finds files with vowels only in their pathnames, not necessarily just the filename. It fails to differentiate between vowels in the entire path versus only in the filename, whereas the expert solution correctly isolates the filenames before searching for vowels."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of files for each unique file extensions in the /testbed directory tree.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f | cut -d '.' -f 2- | sort -u | xargs -I {} find /testbed -type f | grep -c {}
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f | sed -e 's/.*\.//' | sed -e 's/.*\///' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion counts files for each unique extension but does not group and count them correctly. It mistakenly recomputes the same count for all found files with each unique extension."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the total number of lines in all "*.gz" files in the /testbed directory tree after decompression
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.gz" | xargs gzip -cd | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -name '*.gz' | xargs zcat | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful. Both versions use `find` to list all .gz files and `wc -l` to count the lines. The LLM uses `gzip -cd`, which decompresses the files to standard output, equivalent to the expert's use of `zcat`. Both achieve the same outcome."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count lines in each *.php file sorted by file in /testbed directory.
LLM's completion: wc -l --files0-from=/testbed/*.php | sort
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' -type f | sort | xargs wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `wc -l --files0-from=/testbed/*.php`, which tries to use `--files0-from` with a pattern and is not valid syntax. Also, `sort` is used without specifying the input before it. The expert's completion correctly uses `find` to locate all `.php` files, sorts them with `sort`, and then uses `xargs wc -l` to count lines."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts lines in each *.php file in /testbed directory, sorted by number of lines, descending.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" | xargs wc -l | sort -rn -k2
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' -type f | xargs wc -l | sort -nr
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'sort -rn -k2' which sorts based on the second column, assuming the filenames are listed first. However, 'wc -l' outputs the line count first, then the filename, so it should simply be 'sort -nr' to sort by line counts. Additionally, the expert's completion includes '-type f' in the find command to ensure only regular files are considered, which the LLM's completion does not include."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts number of occurences of all ip addresses in '/etc/networks' file, and prints all addresses with number of occurences in a descending order.
LLM's completion: awk '{a[$1]++}END{for(i in a)print i,a[i]}' /etc/networks | sort -rn -k2
Expert's completion: grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' /etc/networks | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion applies the `awk` command to count the occurrences of the first column in each line without specifically targeting IP addresses. The expert's solution explicitly extracts IP addresses using `grep` with a regex pattern, then counts, sorts, and ranks occurrences correctly. Therefore, the LLM's solution is not faithful to the task as it may not correctly identify valid IPs, especially if they aren't the first word on a line."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts total number of only lines with alphanumeric symbols in all *.php files in the /testbed folder and subfolders.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" | xargs grep -E -o '\w+' | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' | xargs cat | awk '/[a-zA-Z0-9]/ {i++} END{print i}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion counts all alphanumeric words, not lines, in the files, so it's not faithful to the task which is counting lines containing alphanumeric symbols."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts total lines in PHP and JS files in /testbed.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f \( -name "*.php" -o -name "*.js" \) | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.js' -or -name '*.php' | xargs wc -l | grep 'total'  | awk '{print $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion counts the number of PHP and JS files, not the total number of lines. The expert's completion correctly counts the total lines in those files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create an empty file "abc.txt" in each directory named "dir1" under testbed directory.
LLM's completion: find testbed -name dir1 -type d | xargs -I {} mkdir -p {}/abc.txt
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type d -name "dir1" -print |  sed 's/$/\/abc.txt/g' | xargs touch
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `mkdir -p {}/abc.txt` which incorrectly attempts to create a directory named 'abc.txt' inside 'dir1'. This doesn't create an empty file as required. The expert solution correctly uses `xargs touch` to create an empty file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create logs.tar.gz of all older than one day logs of Ubuntu
LLM's completion: find /var/log -mtime +1 -print0 | tar -czvf logs.tar.gz -
Expert's completion: find /var/log/ -mtime +1 | xargs  tar -czvPf  /testbed/logs.tar.gz
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion creates a compressed tar archive from logs older than one day, but it omits some details: it uses '-print0' which is good for handling file names with special characters, but uses a hyphen '-' as input to tar, instead of explicitly specifying the files as in the expert’s solution. The expert also uses 'xargs' and a specified path '/testbed/logs.tar.gz', which makes the location different from 'logs.tar.gz'. Additionally, 'xargs' handles file names robustly without the need for '-print0'. Also, the option '-P' in the expert's completion is for preserving the full path and is missing in the LLM's output. These differences make the LLM's solution not fully faithful to the provided expert translation."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Delete files in "/testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp" that are older than 2 days
LLM's completion: find "/testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp" -type f -mtime +2 -delete
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp -type f -mtime +2 -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions effectively delete files older than 2 days in the specified directory. The LLM uses the '-delete' option, which is a valid and concise method for direct deletion within 'find'. The expert's version uses 'find' with '-print0' coupled with 'xargs', which is another valid method to achieve the same result. Both approaches are faithful to the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the 5 largest files in the /testbed directory and its sub-directories.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -r du -b | sort -rn | head -n 5
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec du -b {} + | sort -rh | head -n 5
is_faithful=True explanation="Both scripts aim to find the 5 largest files in the /testbed directory, including its sub-directories. The LLM's completion uses `find` with `xargs`, while the expert uses `find` with `-exec`. Both methods will achieve the desired result of listing the largest files, sorted by size in descending order and retrieving the top 5."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the 5 smallest files in the /testbed directory and its sub-directories ignoring any empty files.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -size -1k -type f | sort -n | head -5
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -size +0c -exec du -b {} + | sort -n | head -n 5
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find /testbed -size -1k -type f`, which finds files smaller than 1kB. It should include non-empty files of any size. It also doesn't accurately measure file sizes. The expert's completion accounts for non-empty files by using `-size +0c` and correctly sorts them based on actual size with `du -b`. The LLM's approach would not necessarily yield correct results for all scenarios."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the 5 smallest files in the /testbed directory and its sub-directories.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -printf '%s %p\n' | sort -n | head -5 | cut -d''-f2-
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec ls -s {} \; | sort -n  | head -5
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'find' with '-printf', which lists file sizes and paths, then sorts and displays the first 5 entries. However, the 'cut' command is misused (empty delimiter), which results in incorrect output. The expert's translation uses 'find' with 'ls -s' to get sizes (in blocks) and paths, sorts them, and limits to 5. Therefore, the LLM's completion isn't fully faithful due to the 'cut' command error."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the five biggest file sizes only in the /testbed directory
LLM's completion: du -a /testbed | sort -rn -k 1 | head -5
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -maxdepth 1 -exec du -b {} + | sort -rh | head -n 5
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `du -a`, which includes directories and does not restrict to files only. It also sorts by size using `-k 1`, which might not always correctly sort by numeric size due to potential variations in output format. The expert's completion uses `find` to ensure only files are included and utilizes `du -b` to get raw sizes, only from the specified directory without descending into subdirectories, ensuring accurate sorting by size with `sort -rh`."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find .java files in the testbed directory tree that contain 'Hello', and print their names
LLM's completion: find testbed -name *.java | grep Hello
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.java" -exec grep -Hin Hello {} + | cut -d ":" -f 1 | xargs -I{} basename {}
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion is not faithful to the task. It uses `grep` directly on the output of `find`, which only searches through the filenames for \'Hello\'. The task requires searching within the contents of the .java files. Additionally, the `-name *.java` will not work as intended without quotes. It should be `-name "*.java"`. The correct approach involves using `-exec` to search within file contents or `xargs` for proper piping and searching.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print a list of all duplicate case insensitive filenames in the /testbed directory tree
LLM's completion: find /testbed -iname '*.*' -type f | sort | uniq -d -c | sort -rn | grep -v'1 '
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f | awk -F/ '{print $NF}' | sort -f | uniq -i -d
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not correctly identify duplicate filenames. It uses `uniq -d -c` incorrectly for counting, and `grep -v'1 '` to filter, which doesn't align with the requirement to identify case insensitive duplicates. It also applies a case insensitive filter immediately, which does not achieve the task as intended. The expert completion uses `awk` to extract the filenames and `uniq -i -d` correctly to find duplicates case insensitively."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print all unique file paths under "testbed/dir1" compared to "testbed/dir2"
LLM's completion: find testbed/dir1 -print0 | xargs -0 -i -r find testbed/dir2 -print0 | sort -z | uniq -z
Expert's completion: comm -23 <(find /testbed/dir1 | sed 's#/testbed/dir1/##' | sort) <(find /testbed/dir2 | sed 's#/testbed/dir2/##' | sort) | sed 's#^#/testbed/dir1/#'
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion does not faithfully address the task because it does not compare the contents of "testbed/dir1" and "testbed/dir2" to find unique paths. Instead, it incorrectly uses find and xargs together without properly comparing or extracting unique elements between the directories. The expert version uses \'comm\' to correctly compare the differences and extract unique file paths.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively finds all files containing text 'Hello' in /testbed and prints folder where they are placed.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec grep -q "Hello" {} \; -print
Expert's completion: grep -rl 'Hello' /testbed | xargs -I {} dirname {} | sort | uniq
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` to locate files and prints their paths if they contain 'Hello'. However, it does not output the directory name where each file is located, which aligns with the expert's use of `dirname` to extract and print directories."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Prints total number of lines of all *.java files in /testbed folder and subfolders.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.java" | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.java' -print0 |xargs -0 wc -l|grep 'total' |awk '{ print $1 }'
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion uses `find /testbed -name "*.java" | wc -l`, which counts the number of `.java` files instead of counting the total number of lines in these files. The expert\'s completion correctly finds all `.java` files and calculates their total line count.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for all the files in the folder /testbed/dir1 which have sticky bit set and have the permissions 553
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir1 -type f -perm 3315
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir1 -perm 1553
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation uses `-perm 3315`, which is incorrect. The octal `3315` would correspond to sticky bit (1) being set for others and attempt to set SUID/SGID bits (3), which is not correct for finding files with permissions 553, which implies sticky bit and execute permissions set correctly. The expert's completion `-perm 1553` correctly specifies the desired permissions, where 1 indicates sticky bit, and 553 specifies the correct file permissions."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for php files in /testbed directory and search for "world" in all these files
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" | xargs grep -i "world"
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' -exec grep -iq "world" {} \; -print
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion is faithful to the task. It searches for PHP files in the /testbed directory and uses xargs to search for the word "world" within those files. While the method differs from the expert\'s use of `-exec`, both achieve the same result.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively finds all files with any cased text "Hello" in the '/system/folder1' folder, and precedes found string with its number in file.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -type f -exec grep -Hn 'hello' {} \;
Expert's completion: grep -inr "Hello" /system/folder1
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion uses the `-Hn` flag which displays the filename and line number, but it doesn\'t handle case insensitivity and doesn\'t prepend the line number to \'Hello\'. The expert\'s solution uses `grep -inr", making it case insensitive and recursive, but doesn\'t prepend numbers; both solutions deviate from the original task intent.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively finds all files with whole word "foo" in the '/system', and precedes found string with its number in file.
LLM's completion: find /system -type f -exec sed -i "s/foo/1foo/g" {} \;
Expert's completion: grep -rnw /system -e "foo"
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion modifies files by prepending 'foo' with '1foo', which doesn't meet the requirement to just find files with the word 'foo'. The expert's version correctly finds occurrences of the exact word 'foo' without altering the files, by using 'grep -rnw'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively list contents of the '/system' directory in a tree-like format
LLM's completion: tree -L 2 -d /system
Expert's completion: tree /system
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion includes the `-L 2` and `-d` flags, which limit the depth of directory traversal to 2 and only list directories. The natural language description specifies a recursive listing of all contents, not limiting depth or to directories only. The expert's completion more accurately reflects the task by recursively listing all contents of '/system' in a tree format without depth limitations."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively print all files and directories in the '/system/folder2' directory tree including hidden files
LLM's completion: find /system/folder2 -type f -o -type d -print
Expert's completion: tree -a /system/folder2
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` to list files and directories, but it doesn't handle recursion or print the directory structure in a formatted way. Also, it doesn't include hidden files due to the lack of `-a` or similar option. The expert's completion, using `tree -a`, correctly includes hidden files and recursively prints the directory structure."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively prints all folders in the '/system' folder that contain files like "*.out".
LLM's completion: find /system -type f -name "*.out"
Expert's completion: find /system -type f -name "*.out" -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 dirname | sort -u
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion finds files, not folders, and does not filter folders containing '*.out' files. The expert's completion correctly extracts unique directory names containing such files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all "*.txt" files in the '/system' folder and answer "y" to any prompt
LLM's completion: find /system -name "*.txt" -delete
Expert's completion: yes y | rm -r /system/*.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's command uses 'find' with '-delete', effectively removing all '*.txt' files, but it doesn't address answering 'y' to any prompts. The expert's command uses 'yes y' piped into 'rm', ensuring 'y' is answered to any confirmation prompt, which the LLM's version neglects."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively removes all empty folders under /system/folder3/temp, printing info message on each operation, and suppressing error messages if folder is not empty.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -type d -empty -delete -print
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -type d -empty -exec rmdir -vp --ignore-fail-on-non-empty {} +
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful because it uses `-delete` which does not suppress errors if the folder is not empty, and it doesn't produce info messages like the `-exec rmdir -vp --ignore-fail-on-non-empty` option used in the expert's completion. The expert's command uses `rmdir -vp --ignore-fail-on-non-empty` to provide verbose messages and suppress errors for non-empty directories, which the LLM's does not replicate."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively removes all files in the /system/folder1 folder but '*txt' files.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -maxdepth 1 -type f -not -name '*txt' -delete
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -type f -not -name '*txt' | xargs rm
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's solution uses '-maxdepth 1', which prevents the command from being recursive. This limits deletion to only the immediate files in '/system/folder1', not its subdirectories. The expert's solution doesn't impose such a limitation, allowing recursion."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively rename all files under /system/folder2 replacing special with regular.
LLM's completion: mv /system/folder2/* /system/folder2/
Expert's completion: find /system/folder2 -type f -name '*special*' ! -path '*/special/*' -execdir bash -c 'mv "$0" "${0/special/regular}"' {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `mv` to move all files, but it does not rename files nor does it handle recursion. It doesn't address the task of replacing 'special' with 'regular' in filenames. The expert's solution correctly uses `find` with `-execdir` to recursively rename files containing 'special' in their names, replacing it with 'regular'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively search for "foo" in the '/system' folder and write the output to the console followed by the number of matched lines
LLM's completion: agrep -q --file-list /system --recursive --foo foo
Expert's completion: grep -r "foo" /system | tee >(wc -l)
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'agrep', which is not a standard command for recursive search in bash for 'foo' and it also incorrectly uses '--foo' as an option. The translation does not capture the requirement to display the output and count the number of matched lines. The expert's completion correctly uses 'grep -r' for recursive search and 'tee' and 'wc -l' to display the output and count the lines."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively search for all regular files below directory "/system/folder3/", and output the name of each, without any containing directories.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder3/ -type f | cut -d'/' -f4-
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/ -type f -exec basename {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `cut` to attempt to remove directory parts, but it assumes a specific directory structure depth, which might not generalize. The expert's completion is more robust, using `basename` to ensure only filenames are output, regardless of directory depth."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively unzip files to stdout in "/system/folder2.tar.gz" and search for "special"
LLM's completion: tar -xvf /system/folder2.tar.gz | grep special
Expert's completion: zcat -r /system/folder2.tar.gz | grep "special"
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion (`tar -xvf /system/folder2.tar.gz | grep special`) does not recursively unzip to stdout but rather extracts the contents to the file system. The expert\'s completion (`zcat -r /system/folder2.tar.gz | grep "special"`) correctly unzips to stdout and uses `zcat` for gzipped files.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove "\r" at the end of each line in "system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt" and display the result as printable characters or backslash escapes
LLM's completion: awk '{print substr($0,1,length($0)-1)}' "system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt"
Expert's completion: cat /system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt | sed 's/\r$//' | od -c
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion removes the last character of each line, assuming it's '\\r', but it does not display the result as printable characters or backslash escapes. The expert's completion uses `od -c` to display characters in a way that shows non-printable characters and backslash escapes."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.doc files from the /system/folder1 tree
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -name "*.doc" -delete
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -name '*.doc' -exec rm "{}" \;
is_faithful=True explanation='Both the LLM\'s completion and the expert\'s completion effectively remove all \'.doc\' files from the /system/folder1 directory tree. The LLM\'s use of \'-delete\' within the find command is a more straightforward option to achieve this task, whereas the expert\'s use of \'-exec rm "{}" \\;\' is a more traditional method that explicitly specifies the removal process. Both approaches accomplish the same goal.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.log files from the /system/folder1 tree
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -name "*.log" -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -name '*.log' -print0 | xargs -0 rm
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` with `-exec rm {}` to directly remove each '.log' file found in the directory tree, which effectively performs the task described. This approach is a valid and common way to achieve the goal, similar to using `xargs` in the expert's solution. Both methods fulfill the task of removing all '.log' files from the directory tree."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.txt files in '/system' directory but not in it's subdirectories
LLM's completion: find /system -maxdepth 1 -name "*.txt" -delete
Expert's completion: find /system -name '*.txt' -maxdepth 1 | xargs rm
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion uses `find /system -maxdepth 1 -name "*.txt" -delete`, which correctly restricts the search to the \'/system\' directory without descending into subdirectories, matching the intended functionality. The `-delete` option directly removes the files found by `find`, making it a faithful translation of the task.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.sql files in the '/system/folder3/backup_dbg' directory that were last modified more than 25 days ago
LLM's completion: find '/system/folder3/backup_dbg' -name '*.sql' -mtime +25 -delete
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/backup_dbg/*.sql -mtime +25 -exec rm -f {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `find` command with `-name` to locate all `*.sql` files, and `-mtime +25` to find those modified over 25 days ago. It then applies `-delete` to remove them. This approach is correct and aligns with the natural language description, though it differs slightly in technique from the expert's use of `-exec rm -f {} \\;`, which is a more explicit way to delete each file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.txt files under the /system/folder1 directory modified more than 5 minutes ago
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -name "*.txt" -mtime +5 -delete
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -mmin +5 -type f -name "*.txt" -delete
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-mtime +5`, which refers to files modified more than 5 days ago, rather than 5 minutes. The correct flag to use for minutes is `-mmin`, as the expert's completion shows."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.txt files, except "keep.txt", under /system/folder1 directory modified more than 5 minutes ago. Do not include subdirectories.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -maxdepth 1 -mtime +5 -type f -not -name "keep.txt" -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -maxdepth 1 -mmin +5 -type f -name "*.txt" ! -name "keep.txt" -delete
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses '-mtime +5', which checks for files modified more than 5 days ago, instead of '-mmin +5', which checks for files modified more than 5 minutes ago. Additionally, it doesn't restrict the operation to '*.txt' files, missing an essential aspect of the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all .sh files in the '/system/folder1' tree whose names begin with "new"
LLM's completion: find '/system/folder1' -name 'new*.sh' -delete
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -name 'new*.sh' -exec rm -f '{}' \;
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and expert's completions correctly use the `find` command to search for files named 'new*.sh' in the '/system/folder1' directory, and remove them. The LLM uses the `-delete` option, which is equivalent to the expert's use of `-exec rm -f '{}' \\;`. Both achieve the intended task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all a.out, *.o, and core files under the '/system' directory
LLM's completion: find /system -name 'a.out' -o -name '*.o' -o -name 'core' | xargs rm -f
Expert's completion: find /system \( -name a.out -o -name '*.o' -o -name 'core' \) -exec rm {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the expert's and the LLM's translations use the `find` command to locate files named `a.out`, `*.o`, and `core` under the `/system` directory. The LLM's version uses `xargs rm -f` to remove the files, while the expert's solution uses `-exec rm {} \\;`. Both achieve the same end result, though the methods differ slightly."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the last five lines of /system/folder1/data.csv
LLM's completion: tail -n 5 /system/folder1/data.csv
Expert's completion: cat /system/folder1/data.csv | rev | cut -d, -f-5 | rev
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses the `tail -n 5` command to display the last five lines of the specified file, which matches the task description. The expert's solution is overly complex and does not accomplish the task as described, making the LLM's solution both simpler and faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all directories called "temp" from the /system directory tree
LLM's completion: rm -rf /system/temp
Expert's completion: find /system -name "temp" -type d -delete
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion only targets a specific directory path '/system/temp' and attempts to remove it, while the expert's completion searches for all directories named 'temp' within the entire '/system' directory tree and deletes them. The task is to find and remove all instances, not just a specific path."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all empty files in /system/folder3/temp and below
LLM's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -type f -empty -delete
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -type f -empty -print | xargs rm -f
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion and the expert's completion both use the 'find' command to locate and handle empty files within the specified directory and its subdirectories.\n\n- The LLM's command: `find /system/folder3/temp -type f -empty -delete` directly deletes the empty files that it finds.\n- The expert's command: `find /system/folder3/temp -type f -empty -print | xargs rm -f` lists the empty files and then uses `xargs rm -f` to delete them.\n\nBoth methods achieve the same result of removing the empty files; hence, the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all files a.out and *.o in the /system directory tree that were modified less than 7 days ago
LLM's completion: find /system -name 'a.out' -o -name '*.o' -mtime -7 -exec rm -f {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system \( -name a.out -o -name '*.o' \) -mtime -7 -exec rm {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is missing parentheses around the '-name' conditions, which is necessary to group them. This would ensure the '-mtime -7' condition applies to both 'a.out' and '*.o'. Without parentheses, the '-o' operator might not behave as intended in some versions of 'find'. Additionally, while the use of '-f' with 'rm' ensures forceful deletion, it wasn't specified in the natural language description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all files and directories under '/system/folder3/temp' directory tree that match with one of the name patterns '.DS_Store', '._.DS_Store' , '._*', '.TemporaryItems' or '.apdisk'

Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/temp \( -name '.DS_Store' -or -name '._.DS_Store' -or -name '._*' -or -name '.TemporaryItems' -or -name '.apdisk' \) -exec rm -rf {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `-type f` flag, which restricts the search to files only. The task requires removing both files and directories matching the patterns. Additionally, the LLM uses `-delete`, which is appropriate for files but not necessarily for directory structures that may require recursive removal. The expert's use of `rm -rf` ensures both files and directories are removed as intended."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove everything within parentheses and substitute all non digit characters with a space from "1/2 [3] (27/03/2012 19:32:54) word word word word 4/5" and format the output as a table
LLM's completion: paste -d " " -s "1/2 [3] (27/03/2012 19:32:54) word word word word 4/5" | sed's/[a-zA-Z]//g' | sed's/[()//g' | column -t
Expert's completion: echo '1/2 [3] (27/03/2012 19:32:54) word word word word 4/5' | sed -e 's/(.*)//' -e 's/[^0-9]/ /g' | column -t
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's command does not remove content inside parentheses accurately. The 'sed' command used does not correctly match and remove content within parentheses. Also, the command to replace non-digit characters with a space is incomplete and contains syntax errors. The expert's version correctly removes text within parentheses and replaces non-digit characters with spaces."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove files text2, text3, text4 in directory /system/folder1
LLM's completion: rm /system/folder1/text2 /system/folder1/text3 /system/folder1/text4
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -name 'text[2-4]*' -exec rm {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion directly removes the specified files, which aligns with the task of removing files "text2", "text3", and "text4" in the specified directory. The expert\'s solution incorporates a broader pattern that would also remove files similarly named, but both achieve the requested outcome.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove files that are less than 1KB in size under /system directory
LLM's completion: find /system -size -1k -delete
Expert's completion: find /system -type f -size -1k -exec rm {} +
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` with `-delete`, which can incorrectly handle non-regular files (like directories). The expert's version specifies `-type f` to ensure only regular files are removed, aligning with the task's requirement to remove 'files'. Therefore, the LLM's version isn't perfectly faithful to the specification."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove files modified more than 31 days ago recursively from "/system"
LLM's completion: find /system -mtime +31 -exec rm -f {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system -type f -mtime +31 -exec rm -f {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion removes any file types modified more than 31 days ago, whereas the expert's completion specifically targets regular files due to the '-type f' option. This detail is important to ensure that only files are removed, not directories or other types of items."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print "/system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt" without newline characters.
LLM's completion: echo -e "/system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt"
Expert's completion: paste -sd "" /system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion uses `echo -e`, which simply prints the string, not the contents of the file. This isn\'t faithful to the task of printing the file contents without newlines. The expert\'s completion uses `paste -sd ""`, which merges files\' contents into a single line as specified.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print which files differ between /system/folder1 and /system/folder2.
LLM's completion: git diff --name-only /system/folder1 /system/folder2
Expert's completion: diff -qr /system/folder1 /system/folder2 | sort
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `git diff`, which is inappropriate here as it is designed for comparing Git repositories or paths within them, not arbitrary directories. The expert's completion uses `diff -qr`, which is the correct tool for finding differences between two directories, showing files that differ."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print amount of space available on the file system containing path to the /system directory in megabytes.
LLM's completion: df -k /system | awk '{print $4}' | xargs -i du -s --si | awk '{print $1}' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -i df -k /system | awk '{print $4}' | awk '{print $1}' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -i du -s --si | awk '{print $1}' | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -i df -k /system | awk '{print $4}' | awk '{print $1}' | awk '{print $1}' | awk '{print $1
Expert's completion: df -m /system
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses a complex and incorrect pipeline involving multiple commands and transformations unrelated to the task. The expert's solution, `df -m /system`, directly gives the space available in megabytes, which aligns accurately with the natural language description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the number of sub-directories under /system
LLM's completion: find /system -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /system -type d | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion counts all items (files and directories) in the first level of '/system', while the expert's completion filters to count only directories. To align with the expert's approach, the LLM completion should include '-type d' to only count directories."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Archive all files in /system/folder1 directory modified in the last 60 days to "/mytarfile.tgz" with a time of 2023-01-01, owner of 0, and group of 0.
LLM's completion: tar -czf /mytarfile.tgz --mtime 2023-01-01 --owner=0 --group=0 --mtime 2023-01-01 --files-from=/dev/null /system/folder1
Expert's completion: tar --mtime='2023-01-01' --owner=0 --group=0 -czf mytarfile.tgz `find /system/folder1 -mtime -60`
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not select files modified in the last 60 days as specified. It incorrectly uses '--files-from=/dev/null' which results in no files being archived, and repeats '--mtime', which is not correctly applied in the context to filter files based on modification time."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Write the current date and time followed by " 1" to the console and append to "/system/folder3/temp/empty.txt"
LLM's completion: date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S 1" >> /system/folder3/temp/empty.txt
Expert's completion: echo $(date) "1" | tee -a /system/folder3/temp/empty.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'date' with a format string that includes '1', which results in '1' being part of the date format rather than appended as a separate value. The expert's completion uses 'echo' to append '1' after the current date and time, which is the correct approach per the description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Concatenate all .txt files residing in the /system tree into a single file "/system/folder3/temp/concat.txt"
LLM's completion: find /system -type f -name "*.txt" -exec cat {} \; > /system/folder3/temp/concat.txt
Expert's completion: find /system -name "*.txt" -not -name "concat.txt" -print -exec cat {} \; > /system/folder3/temp/concat.txt
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion will include \'concat.txt\' if it exists within the search path, causing an unintended recursion or overwriting issue. The expert\'s completion correctly prevents this by excluding \'concat.txt\' from the operation using \'-not -name "concat.txt"\'. Both use \'find\' to locate files and concatenate them, but the expert ensures exclusion of the output file.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Compresses all the files in the /system folder with default depth to /backup using cpio.
LLM's completion: tar -czf /backup/system.tar.gz /system
Expert's completion: find /system -depth -print | cpio -dump /backup
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `tar` command to compress files from `/system` into a `.tar.gz` archive, whereas the task specifies using `cpio` to copy all files to `/backup` with the default depth. The expert's solution uses `cpio` and the `-depth` option to meet this requirement."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Copy all files in the /system directory except those containing 'text' to '/system/folder3/backup_dbg/backup'. Do not include subdirectories.
LLM's completion: find /system -type f -not -name '*text*' -exec cp {} '/system/folder3/backup_dbg/backup' \;
Expert's completion: find /system -maxdepth 1 -type f ! -name '*text*' -exec cp {} /system/folder3/backup_dbg/backup \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not restrict the search to exclude subdirectories, as it lacks the '-maxdepth 1' option. This means it may copy files from subdirectories, which is against the task requirement."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Dump "/system/text1.txt" as ASCII characters
LLM's completion: dump -b -a /system/text1.txt
Expert's completion: od -t c /system/text1.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the command `dump`, which is incorrect in this context. The `dump` command is typically used for backups and doesn't have `-b` or `-a` options related to dumping ASCII characters. The Expert's completion using `od -t c` is correct for dumping the file as ASCII characters, as `od` can display files in different formats, and `-t c` specifies character output."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a compressed archive of /system/folder1 "compress_folder1.tar.gz" with a time of 2023-01-01, owner of 0, and group of 0.
LLM's completion: tar -czf compress_folder1.tar.gz -C /system/ --mtime=2023-01-01 --owner=0 --group=0 folder1
Expert's completion: tar --mtime='2023-01-01' --owner=0 --group=0 -zcf compress_folder1.tar.gz /system/folder1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `-C` option, which changes to the specified directory before performing the operation, thus potentially altering the resulting archive's structure compared to the expert's completion. The expert's command directly targets `/system/folder1`, which is what the task requests. The change directory approach could lead to different archive content if not intended."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: download content from "http://example.com/textfile.txt" and output to 'textfile.txt' in /system
LLM's completion: curl -o /system/textfile.txt http://example.com/textfile.txt
Expert's completion: curl http://example.com/textfile.txt -o /system/textfile.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses the `curl` command to download content from the specified URL to the specified directory and file. The options used (`-o /system/textfile.txt`) are correct, matching the output file path requirement. The difference in option ordering does not affect the command's functionality."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search in /system downwards all files whose size is greater than 10 bytes.
LLM's completion: find /system -size +10
Expert's completion: find /system -size +10c -print
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is incorrect because it uses `-size +10`, which looks for files larger than 10 *blocks* of 512 bytes, not 10 bytes. The expert’s completion correctly uses `-size +10c` for 10 *bytes*, as 'c' specifies bytes. Additionally, the LLM's command lacks `-print`, which ensures the matching files are displayed."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5sum of each ".txt" file under "/system" and sort the output.
LLM's completion: find /system -name "*.txt" | xargs md5sum | sort
Expert's completion: find /system -type f -name '*.txt' -exec md5sum {} + | awk '{print $1}' | sort
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion accurately identifies '.txt' files under '/system', computes their md5sum, and sorts the output. While it uses xargs instead of -exec, it still accomplishes the same task effectively. The expert's use of awk to isolate the md5 hash could provide a cleaner output, but the core objective is met by the LLM's version."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for the system host name in "/etc/hosts" and print the IP address in the first awk field
LLM's completion: awk '{if ($0 ~ /127\.0\.1\.1/) {print $1}}' /etc/hosts
Expert's completion: more /etc/hosts | grep `hostname` | awk '{print $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion searches for the IP '127.0.1.1' instead of the system host name. The expert's completion correctly uses the system's hostname with `hostname` and then prints the IP address from the first field."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find files in /workspace directory modified within 30 days.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -mtime -30
Expert's completion: find /workspace -daystart -type f -mtime -30
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is missing `-type f`, which restricts the search to files only, and `-daystart`, which ensures that the calculation is based on the start of the current day. Thus, it may return directories or non-file items and use the current time instead of the start of the day for modification time calculations."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: find files in the /workspace directory with pattern` *.c  that larger than 1 Kilobytes
LLM's completion: find /workspace -name "*.c" -size +1k
Expert's completion: find /workspace -name '*.c' -size +1k -print
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion accurately uses the `find` command to locate files in the `/workspace` directory that match the `*.c` pattern and are larger than 1 Kilobytes. The `-print` option is optional as it is implied by default, so the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find files in the /workspace directory and sub-directories, that changed over an hour ago.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -mmin +60
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -cmin +60
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-mmin +60`, which checks for files modified more than 60 minutes ago. The description specifies files that 'changed,' typically associated with the `-cmin` flag (last status change) or `-mmin` for last modification. The expert uses `-cmin +60`, aligning more with 'change.' Additionally, the expert specifies `-type f` to ensure only files are listed, which matches the intent implicitly given in the description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find files in the /workspace directory and sub-directories, that were accessed over an hour ago.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -amin -60
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -amin +60
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion, `find /workspace -amin -60`, is incorrect because it finds files accessed less than 60 minutes ago, rather than more than. Additionally, it does not specify files explicitly with `-type f`. The expert's completion, `find /workspace -type f -amin +60`, correctly specifies finding files accessed more than 60 minutes ago."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list all the drectories present in the /workspace directory and do not search in the sub directories.
LLM's completion: ls /workspace
Expert's completion: find /workspace -maxdepth 1 -type d
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `ls /workspace` lists both directories and files in the /workspace directory, while the expert's completion specifically lists only directories without searching subdirectories. Only the expert's command faithfully executes the requirement."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list all the files in the /workspace directory which are of size 0 bytes.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -size 0 -print
Expert's completion: find /workspace -empty
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion and the expert's completion achieve the same goal. The command `find /workspace -size 0 -print` lists files in `/workspace` that have a size of 0 bytes. The expert's version `find /workspace -empty` also finds empty files, which inherently have a size of 0 bytes. Both are faithful to the task of listing files of size 0 bytes in the specified directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list all zero-length files under the /workspace directory
LLM's completion: find /workspace -size 0
Expert's completion: find /workspace -empty -exec ls {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task as it correctly uses the `find` command with the `-size 0` option to list zero-length files, which matches the description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: locate and remove large files (> 1 KB) in /workspace
LLM's completion: find /workspace -size +1k -exec rm -f {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -size +1k -delete
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find /workspace -size +1k -exec rm -f {} \\;` to locate and remove files larger than 1KB in /workspace. This command is faithful because:\n\n1. `find /workspace -size +1k` correctly identifies files greater than 1KB.\n2. `-exec rm -f {} \\;` removes the files found.\n\nThe expert's completion uses `-delete`, which is a more concise method but achieves the same result as removing the files. Therefore, the LLM's translation is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all the files in the /workspace directory which have only read permission to the group.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -perm g=r
Expert's completion: find /workspace -perm 400 -type f -exec ls -l {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `find /workspace -type f -perm g=r` attempts to find files with group read permission, but it doesn't correctly restrict files to having only read permission for the group.\n\nThe expert's completion specifies `-perm 400`, which is incorrect for the task because 400 specifies owner's read permission only, not group's read permission. The Bash command should involve `-perm` and a complex condition to ensure only the group has read permission without others having additional permissions. A corrected attempt should look like:\n\n```bash\nfind /workspace -type f -perm -040 -exec ls -l {} \\;\n```\n\nThe LLM's completion is not faithful to the task because it does not capture the requirement to ensure that the files have only read permission for the group and not any other additional permissions."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all the files in the /workspace directory which have permissions 777.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -perm 777
Expert's completion: find /workspace -perm 777 -type f -exec ls -l {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion accurately captures the key requirements of the task: finding files in the /workspace directory with permissions set to 777. The command `find /workspace -type f -perm 777` effectively lists all regular files (`-type f`) with the specified permissions (`-perm 777`). The expert's completion adds an `ls -l` execution to display detailed information, but this doesn't change the core task fulfillment. Therefore, the LLM's output is faithful to the natural language description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List the details of all the text files in /workspace directory.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec file {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -name "*.txt" -exec ls -ld {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion lists details of all files, not specifically text files, in /workspace. The expert's completion accurately lists details of files with a .txt extension."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: move all files in the /workspace folder to / and do not move the files in the sub folder
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -not -path '/workspace/*' -exec mv {} / \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec mv -t / {} +
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful to the task. It incorrectly applies '-not -path', which excludes all files under '/workspace', including those at the top level. As a result, it won't move any files. The correct approach, as seen in the expert's completion, uses '-maxdepth 1' to ensure only files directly in '/workspace' (not in subdirectories) are considered."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Move files in /workspace accessed less than one day ago to directory /.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -mtime 1 -exec mv {}. \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -atime -1 -type f -exec mv {} / \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-mtime 1` instead of `-atime -1`. `-mtime 1` finds files with a modification time exactly one day ago, whereas `-atime -1` finds files accessed within the last day. Additionally, the LLM’s syntax `{}. \\;` is incorrect—it should be `{} \\;` after the file path in the `mv` command. The expert solution correctly identifies files accessed less than one day ago."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print all filenames of files under /workspace/dir1 dir containing 'hello', case-insensitive
LLM's completion: find /workspace/dir1 -iname '*hello*'
Expert's completion: find /workspace/dir1 -type f -exec grep -il 'hello' {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion only searches for files whose names contain 'hello' (case-insensitive) in the specified directory, but does not check the actual content of the files for the presence of 'hello'. The expert's completion correctly searches through the content of each file for 'hello', using 'grep -il', aligning with the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print disk usage of files or folders in /workspace
LLM's completion: du /workspace
Expert's completion: du -sh /workspace
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion `du /workspace` will display the disk usage of the files and folders in `/workspace`, fulfilling the task requirements. However, the expert's version `du -sh /workspace` provides a summary in human-readable format, making it slightly more user-friendly, but both fulfill the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the last word in /workspace/dir1/long.txt
LLM's completion: tail -n 1 /workspace/dir1/long.txt | cut -d''-f4
Expert's completion: tac /workspace/dir1/long.txt | awk 'NF{print $NF; exit}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to use 'tail' to get the last line of the file, but misinterprets the task by using 'cut' with incorrect delimiters and field options. It does not actually target the last word. The expert's completion correctly uses 'tac' to reverse the file order and 'awk' to find and print the last word accurately."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the 3 largest directories in /workspace.
LLM's completion: du -s /workspace/* | sort -rn | head -3
Expert's completion: du -a /workspace | sort -nr | head -n 3
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion and the expert's completion are attempting to identify the largest directories within '/workspace'.\n\nThe LLM's command `du -s /workspace/* | sort -rn | head -3` works by:\n1. Using `du -s` to summarize the disk usage of each directory under '/workspace'.\n2. Sorting the results in reverse numerical order with `sort -rn`.\n3. Extracting the top 3 results with `head -3`.\n\nThe expert's command `du -a /workspace | sort -nr | head -n 3` works similarly but uses `-a`, which lists directories and files, not summarizing them individually. The expert's approach might include both files and directories as separate entities, but it expects directories to be significantly larger, thus appearing in the top.\n\nIn this context, the LLM’s completion is faithful to the requirement of listing the 3 largest directories because it explicitly summarizes directory sizes and extracts them accordingly."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: prints first line of "/workspace/dir1/long.txt"
LLM's completion: head -1 /workspace/dir1/long.txt
Expert's completion: head -n1 /workspace/dir1/long.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is functionally equivalent to the expert's. Both `head -1` and `head -n1` are valid commands to print the first line of a file in bash."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: prints the last non-empty line of "/workspace/dir1/a.txt"
LLM's completion: tail -n 1 /workspace/dir1/a.txt
Expert's completion: tac /workspace/dir1/a.txt | grep -m 1 '.'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `tail -n 1 /workspace/dir1/a.txt` only prints the last line, whether it is non-empty or not. It does not check if the line is non-empty. The expert's completion uses `tac` to reverse the file and `grep -m 1 '.'` to find the first non-empty line."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: prune all the files in the /workspace directory
LLM's completion: git rm -rf --cached /workspace
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -delete
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `git rm -rf --cached /workspace`, which is not appropriate for pruning files in a directory. This command removes cached files from the git index, not from the filesystem.\n\nThe expert's completion `find /workspace -type f -delete` is correct as it deletes all files in the specified directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for all the files in the  /workspace directory which have size greater than 1KB (approx) and less than 32KB(approx).
LLM's completion: find /workspace -size +1k -size -32k
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -size +1k -size -32k
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion lacks the '-type f' option, which ensures that only regular files are searched. Without this, directories or other types might be included, making the LLM's response not entirely faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for all the files in the  /workspace folder and sort them in the order of their depth and display the file names
LLM's completion: find /workspace/ -type f | sed's/[^\/]*\///' | sort -u | sort -d
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f | awk -F/ '{print NF, $0}' | sort -n
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion contains several issues:\n\n1. It uses `sed's/[^\\/]*\\///'`, which appears to be incorrectly formatted due to a misplaced quotation mark and is not correctly isolating the depth of the files.\n\n2. It sorts uniquely (`sort -u`) and then attempts a depth sort (`sort -d`), which doesn't match the intention of sorting by depth.\n\n3. The completion does not accurately handle sorting based on the depth as the expert's does with `awk -F/ '{print NF, $0}' | sort -n`.\n\nThe LLM's approach deviates from accurately sorting files by depth as described in the natural language description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for all the files in the /workspace folder which are bigger than 1KB and display the biggest file.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -size +1k -exec ls -l {} \; | sort -r -k 5
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -size +1k -exec ls -ls {} + | sort -n | tail -1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion correctly finds files larger than 1KB in /workspace, but its sorting command is incorrect for finding the biggest file. It sorts by the fifth column, which is not explicitly the file size, and does not properly identify the largest file. Additionally, it does not select the biggest file after sorting. The expert solution sorts by size and uses 'tail -1' to display the biggest file, which ensures accuracy."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for text files in the  /workspace folder which do not have write access to others
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -name "*.txt" -not -perm /u+w -exec ls -ld {} \;
Expert's completion: find  /workspace -type f \( -iname "*.txt" -not -perm -o=w \)
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion searches for files that do not have write access for the user (owner), as indicated by '-perm /u+w'. The task requires finding files that do not have write access for 'others', which should be '-o=w'. Thus, the LLM's completion misunderstands the permission requirement."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for the directory "mysql" in the workspace directory.
LLM's completion: find /home/user/workspace -name mysql
Expert's completion: find  /workspace -name mysql -type d
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion specifies the absolute path "/home/user/workspace" and does not constrain the search to directories only. The expert\'s completion assumes the workspace is directly at "/workspace," and correctly restricts the search to directories with "-type d."'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print a list of all duplicate case insensitive filenames in the /workspace directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -iname '*.*' -print0 | sort -z | uniq -z -d
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f | awk -F/ '{print $NF}' | sort -f | uniq -i -d
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to list all duplicate filenames by sorting and using `uniq -d`. However, it does not ignore the directory path or make the comparison case-insensitive properly. It uses `-iname` for case insensitivity in the `find` command but does not handle filtering filenames only nor does it check their case-insensitive duplicates effectively. The expert's version correctly isolates filenames, handles case insensitivity using `sort -f` and `uniq -i`, and ensures duplicates are identified by filename only."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for the file old2.txt in the /workspace folder and list its permissions and creation time.
LLM's completion: find /workspace/ -name old2.txt -exec stat -c "%a %y" {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -name old2.txt | xargs ls -tl
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion correctly uses `find` to locate the file and `stat` to list permissions and time details, which fulfills the natural language description to check permissions and creation time. The use of `stat -c "%a %y"` retrieves the permissions in numeric mode and the last modification time, which is typically used interchangeably with \'creation time\' in Unix-like systems as actual creation time is not stored in inodes.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for the word "hello" in all the regular/normal files in the  /workspace folder and display the matched file name
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -name "*.txt" -exec grep -q "hello" {} \; -print
Expert's completion: find  /workspace -type f | xargs grep -l "hello"
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion limits the search to files with the ".txt" extension by using `-name "*.txt"`, which was not specified in the task. The expert\'s completion searches all types of files with `-type f`, which matches the natural language description of \'all the regular/normal files\'.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of all files in the /workspace directory with the filename printed first
LLM's completion: find /workspace | while read f; do echo "$f"; md5sum "$f"; done
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec md5sum {} + | awk '{print $2 " " $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion lists both files and directories and calculates MD5 checksums for them, whereas the task specifically asks for calculating MD5 sums of files only. Additionally, it does not print the filename first before the checksum."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of all files in directory tree "/workspace"
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec md5sum {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion accurately captures the task of calculating the md5 sum of all files under the /workspace directory by using `find` to locate files and `md5sum` to compute their checksums. The only difference is the lack of sorting the output, which isn't explicit in the natural language description. Thus, the key operation is present and correct."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of unique 3 to 6 character file extensions are in the /workspace directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f | cut -d '.' -f 2- | cut -d '.' -f 1-6 | sort -u | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -name '*.*' | awk -F. 'NF>1 {ext=tolower($NF); if (length(ext) >= 3 && length(ext) <= 6) print ext}' | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to count unique file extensions but fails to correctly isolate and filter extensions by length. It also does not convert extensions to lowercase, which may miss unique entries that differ only in case. Additionally, the command assumes that extensions are separated only by dots without considering multiple dots in filenames correctly. The expert's completion, however, properly accounts for the length condition and case sensitivity."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a copy of the /workspace directory structure in the /usr directory,
LLM's completion: rsync -avz /workspace/ /usr/
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type d -print|sed 's@^@/usr/@'|xargs mkdir -p
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `rsync -avz`, which copies the entire directory structure and its contents to the `/usr/` directory, whereas the task specifies replicating only the directory structure itself, not the contents. The expert's completion creates the necessary directories in `/usr` using `find`, `sed`, and `xargs mkdir -p`, which faithfully adheres to the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display a long listing of the oldest file under '/workspace' directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -ld
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -printf '%T+ %p\n' | sort | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2}' | xargs ls -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion lists all files using `ls -ld`, not specifically the oldest one. It doesn't sort by modification time, missing the intent to find and display the oldest file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find the largest 2 directories under /workspace directory
LLM's completion: find /workspace -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec du -s {} \; | sort -rn | head -n2 | awk '{print $2}'
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type d -print0 | xargs -0 du | sort -n | tail -2 | cut -f2 | xargs -I{} du -sh {}
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion limits the search to the top level of the /workspace directory with '-maxdepth 1', which may miss larger subdirectories within subdirectories. The expert's completion finds directories at all depths, making it a more faithful approach to finding the largest directories."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all files with their paths that have identical content in /workspace directory
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; | sort | uniq -d | cut -d\  -f2- | xargs -d$'\n' find /workspace -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; | sort | uniq -d | cut -d\  -f2- | xargs -d$'\n'
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f | xargs md5sum | sort | uniq -Dw32
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to find duplicate files using their SHA-256 hashes but has flaws. \n\nFirst, it does the hash calculation twice (`find ... -exec sha256sum`), which is unnecessary and inefficient. \n\nSecond, the command `uniq -d` alone will not work properly without a preceding `sort`, but an effective sorting and `uniq` mechanism also needs a count-based duplication flag (`-D`) to ensure it detects duplicates based on content.\n\nIn the expert's solution, `md5sum` is used with `uniq -Dw32` to capture duplicates effectively, which is absent in the LLM's output.\n\nThus, the LLM's completion is unnecessarily complex and fails to correctly identify duplicate files based on content."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Make directories for each unique file path in "/workspace/files.txt"
LLM's completion: mkdir -p $(sort -u -f -t / -d -k 1,1 /workspace/files.txt | cut -d/ -f2- | tr '\n''')
Expert's completion: cat /workspace/files.txt |xargs -I {} dirname "{}"| sort -u | xargs -I{} mkdir -p "{}"
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts a complex and incorrect approach. It uses `sort` with flags that don't make sense for this context, and misuses `cut` and `tr`. Therefore, it doesn't faithfully create directories for each unique file path.\n\nThe expert solution uses `dirname` to extract directories, sorts them uniquely, and then creates directories with `mkdir -p`, which is the correct approach."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the total disk usage in bytes of all files listed in "/workspace/files.txt"
LLM's completion: du -b /workspace/files.txt | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}'
Expert's completion: cat /workspace/files.txt | xargs du -b | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion calculates the disk usage of the file listing itself, "/workspace/files.txt", and sums its size, rather than calculating the total disk usage of all files listed within "/workspace/files.txt". On the other hand, the expert\'s solution reads the file list from "/workspace/files.txt" and calculates the total disk usage of those files, which is faithful to the task description.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Unhide all hidden files in the /workspace directory. Do not include subdirectories.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -name.* -exec ls -d {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '.*' -exec sh -c 'mv "$0" "${0%/\.*}/${0##*/.}"' {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion lists hidden files including those in subdirectories, without renaming them to unhide. It lacks the restriction to the first level and does not change file names to unhide them. The expert's completion uses -maxdepth 1 to restrict to top-level files and renames them to remove the dot prefix."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of differing lines in "/workspace/dir1/long.txt" and "/workspace/dir1/terminate.txt"
LLM's completion: git diff --numstat /workspace/dir1/long.txt /workspace/dir1/terminate.txt
Expert's completion: diff /workspace/dir1/long.txt /workspace/dir1/terminate.txt | grep ^[\>\<] | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `git diff --numstat`, which is intended to show the number of changed lines in terms of additions and deletions in a format suitable for files tracked by Git. However, it does not directly count differing lines between two arbitrary files. The expert's solution, on the other hand, uses `diff` combined with `grep` and `wc -l` to effectively count the differing lines, which is more faithful to the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of differing lines in "/workspace/dir1/terminate.txt" and "/workspace/dir1/long.txt" with 0 lines of unified context
LLM's completion: git diff --no-unified --name-only --diff-context --exit-code /workspace/dir1/terminate.txt /workspace/dir1/long.txt | wc -l
Expert's completion: diff -U 0 /workspace/dir1/terminate.txt /workspace/dir1/long.txt | grep -v ^@ | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's command uses `git diff` and includes options like `--no-unified`, `--name-only`, and `--diff-context` which are either irrelevant or incorrectly used for counting differing lines. It also lacks the usage of `grep` to filter non-context lines before counting. The expert's command correctly uses `diff -U 0` to set 0 lines of unified context and `grep -v ^@` to exclude context lines."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts lines in file /workspace/dir1/a.txt ignoring empty lines and lines with spaces only.
LLM's completion: wc -l /workspace/dir1/a.txt
Expert's completion: awk '!/^[[:space:]]*$/{++x} END{print x}' /workspace/dir1/a.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `wc -l` which counts all lines including empty lines and lines with spaces. The expert's completion uses `awk` to exclude empty lines and lines with only spaces, making it faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a symbolic link in directory "~/newlinks" for each file listed in "/workspace/results.txt"
LLM's completion: ln -s -f /workspace/results.txt ~/newlinks
Expert's completion: cat /workspace/results.txt | xargs -I{} ln -s {} ~/newlinks
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion creates a single symbolic link pointing from `~/newlinks` to `/workspace/results.txt`. It does not iterate over each file listed in `/workspace/results.txt` to create individual symbolic links, as required. The expert's completion correctly uses `xargs` to create a symbolic link for each file listed."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Delete all hidden files under /workspace
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -name ".*" -delete
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -name '.*' -delete
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. It correctly uses the 'find' command, searches for files with names starting with a '.', and deletes them. The use of double quotes in the LLM's completion instead of single quotes does not affect functionality in this context, as both are valid for specifying the pattern."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display a dump of "/workspace/dir1/long.txt" as floating point values of double size
LLM's completion: dprintf -f -e -w 8 /workspace/dir1/long.txt
Expert's completion: od -t fD /workspace/dir1/long.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `dprintf`, which doesn't make sense in this context. The task requires treating the file as binary data and interpreting it as double precision floating point numbers. The expert correctly uses `od -t fD`, where `od` is used for dumping file contents with `-t fD` to specify double-precision floats."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display differences between list of files in /workspace/dir1 and /workspace/dir2.
LLM's completion: git diff --no-commit --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACMRTUXB /workspace/dir1 /workspace/dir2
Expert's completion: diff <(ls /workspace/dir1) <(ls /workspace/dir2)
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `git diff`, which is incorrect because it assumes a git repository context and not just comparing file lists. The task requires comparing the lists of files in two directories using something like `ls` with `diff` as shown in the expert's completion."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the file size of file '/workspace/dir1/sum.c' in bytes
LLM's completion: stat /workspace/dir1/sum.c | awk '{print $2}'
Expert's completion: du -sb /workspace/dir1/sum.c | cut -f1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'stat' and 'awk', but this is incorrect for directly obtaining the file size in bytes. The 'stat' command output format is system-dependent and does not directly yield the size in a consistent position for 'awk' to process. \n\nThe expert's completion uses 'du -sb', which correctly provides the size in bytes using a straightforward approach by summarizing the file in bytes."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the last slash-separated part of each filename path in /workspace/dir1/file.txt
LLM's completion: awk -F/ '{print $(NF)}' /workspace/dir1/file.txt
Expert's completion: rev /workspace/dir1/file.txt | cut -d/ -f1 | rev
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions aim to extract the last part of the path after the final slash from each line in the file. \n\n- The LLM's command uses `awk` with the field separator set to `/`, printing the last field (`$(NF)`) which corresponds to the desired part.\n- The expert's command reverses each line, cuts the first field by `/`, and reverses it again to achieve the same effect.\n\nBoth solutions work correctly and achieve the same result."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the sizes and filepaths of all files/directories in /workspace directory sorted in descending order of size
LLM's completion: du -h --max-depth=1 /workspace | sort -rh
Expert's completion: du /workspace -a -h | sort -hr
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `--max-depth=1` which limits the depth for `du`, potentially missing nested files. The expert’s completion uses `-a` to include all files and directories. The expert's version captures the full structure and content accurately as requested."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print percentage of the space used on the /workspace directory.
LLM's completion: df /workspace | awk '{print ($4 / $2) * 100}'
Expert's completion: df -k /workspace | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to calculate the percentage of space used by dividing the available space by total space, which would instead give the free space percentage if corrected. The expert's completion accurately extracts the 'Used%' column from the `df` command output."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create an empty file "Icon" in workspace/ with a carriage return character in the end of its name.
LLM's completion: touch workspace/Icon\r
Expert's completion: echo $'workspace/Icon\r' | xargs touch
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion `touch workspace/Icon\\r` correctly creates a file named 'Icon' with a carriage return at the end of its name in the directory 'workspace/'. The carriage return is denoted by '\\r', which matches the expert's intention in their completion, although the method differs. Both approaches achieve the same goal, so the LLM's output is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a symbolc link in the /workspace/dir1 to root folder
LLM's completion: ln -s /workspace/dir1/root /workspace/dir1/
Expert's completion: ln /workspace/dir1 -s /
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful to the task. It creates a symbolic link from the root folder to '/workspace/dir1/root', which is incorrect. The expert's completion correctly creates a symbolic link in '/workspace/dir1' pointing to the root folder '/'. The LLM's command misinterprets the path as '/workspace/dir1/root', which doesn't align with the requirement."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display permissions, user, group, and full path for each file in the /workspace directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec stat -c "%n %u %g %a" {} \;
Expert's completion: tree /workspace -p -u -g -f
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` and `stat` to list files with the user ID, group ID, and permissions in octal format, but it doesn't display the permissions in the usual symbolic format (e.g., -rwxr-xr-x). Furthermore, it only applies to files, not directories.\n\nThe expert's completion uses `tree` with options `-p` for permissions in a human-readable symbolic format, `-u` for user name, `-g` for group name, and `-f` for the full path, providing a more comprehensive match to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for 'hello' case insensitively in all files under /workspace directory tree and show the matched lines with their filenames
LLM's completion: grep -r -i hello /workspace
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -print0  | xargs -0 grep -iH "hello"
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `grep -r -i hello /workspace`, which searches recursively and case insensitively for 'hello' in all files under the /workspace directory tree and displays matched lines with their filenames. This is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Unpack all *.gz archives in the /workspace directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -name *.gz | xargs gzip -d
Expert's completion: find /workspace -name '*.gz' -print0 | xargs -0 gunzip
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `gzip -d`, which is similar to `gunzip`, but the command is not entirely safe. If there are spaces or special characters in filenames, it can cause issues. The expert's use of `-print0` and `-0` ensures safe handling of filenames."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Uncompress "/workspace/archive.tar.gz" and extract the archive to "/backup"
LLM's completion: tar -xzf /workspace/archive.tar.gz -C /backup
Expert's completion: gzip -dc /workspace/archive.tar.gz | tar -xf - -C /backup
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `tar` command with the `-xzf` options to uncompress and extract the specified `tar.gz` file directly to the destination directory '/backup'. This is a commonly used and valid method for this task and aligns with the given natural language description.\n\nThe expert's completion achieves the same result by first decompressing the file with `gzip -dc` and then using `tar -xf` to extract it to the same destination. While the approach differs, both achieve the intended outcome.\n\nHence, the LLM's completion is faithful to the original task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Retrieve only build number of current kernel, ie. #104
LLM's completion: uname -r | cut -d'.' -f1,2 | awk '{print $1"."$2"#"}' | cut -d''-f2 | cut -d'#' -f1
Expert's completion: uname -v | grep -o '#[0-9]\+'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's solution attempts to manipulate the output of `uname -r` using several `cut` and `awk` commands. However, `uname -r` returns the kernel release, and the LLM's script attempts to extract the build number by appending a '#', which is not necessarily present or part of the release string format. On the other hand, the expert's solution correctly uses `uname -v`, which provides the kernel version information containing the build number. The expert uses `grep` to directly extract the build number in the format `#104`, making the expert's solution more precise and straightforward."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print reverse lookup for adress 127.0.0.1
LLM's completion: host 127.0.0.1 | nsswitch -type hosts
Expert's completion: dig -x 127.0.0.1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation uses the 'host' command with a pipe to 'nsswitch', which is not a typical method for reverse DNS lookup. The expert's translation uses 'dig -x', which is the correct and standard approach for performing a reverse DNS lookup on an IP address."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List file information of the full path of command "grep"
LLM's completion: ls -l /bin/grep
Expert's completion: ls -ald `which grep`
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation assumes that the 'grep' command is located at '/bin/grep', which may not be accurate across all systems. The expert's completion dynamically finds the full path using the 'which' command to ensure the correct path is used, making it more faithful to the task of listing file information of 'grep' regardless of its location."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Extract host name part from "http://www.google.com"
LLM's completion: extract-host-name-part-from-http-www.google.com.bashextract-host-name-part-from-http-www.google.com="echo www.google.com | sed's/.*\///'"
Expert's completion: echo "http://www.google.com" | cut -d'/' -f3
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to extract a hostname but has syntax errors and does not match the task. It uses the incorrect path to extract from and misuses `sed`. The Expert's completion correctly utilizes `cut` to isolate and extract the host name part of the URL."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List environment variables and their values, escaping all semicolons with a backslash.
LLM's completion: declare -p;
Expert's completion: env | sed 's/;/\\;/g'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `declare -p`, which lists and declares shell variables and functions for the current shell. It does not specifically list environment variables or escape semicolons with a backslash, as required by the task. The expert's completion correctly uses `env` to list environment variables and `sed` to escape semicolons."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Displays a tree of all process alongside their command line arguments.
LLM's completion: ps -ef --forest
Expert's completion: pstree -a
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion using `ps -ef --forest` shows processes in a tree format but does not include command line arguments. The expert's completion `pstree -a` displays a tree with command line arguments, fully meeting the requirements of the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print numbers 1 through 10 separated by ":"
LLM's completion: seq 1 10 | tr'' ":"
Expert's completion: yes | head -n10 | grep -n . | cut -d: -f1 | paste -sd:
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s command `seq 1 10 | tr\'\' ":"` is incorrect because the `tr` command is missing a space between `tr` and its arguments. Even if corrected, using `seq 1 10` would generate numbers 1 to 10, but it needs further processing to include colons (e.g., with `paste -sd:`). The expert solution correctly uses a combination of commands to achieve the desired output with numbers separated by colons.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print all readline bindings
LLM's completion: rlprint-bindingsassistant

rlprint-bindings
Expert's completion: bind -P
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion 'rlprint-bindings' is not a valid Bash command for printing readline bindings. The expert's completion 'bind -P' correctly uses the 'bind' command with the '-P' option to print all readline key bindings."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list names of bind functions containing "p"
LLM's completion: bind -f /dev/null | grep p | cut -d''-f2 | sed's/)/)/' | sed's/(//g' | sed's/ //g' | sed's/.*\(.*\)/\1/' | sed's/.*\(.*\)/\1/' | sed's/.*\(.*\)/\1/' | sed's/.*\(.*\)/\1/' | sed's/.*\(.*\)/\1/' | sed's/.*\(.*\)/\1/' | sed's/.*\(.*
Expert's completion: bind -l | grep p
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is overly complex and incorrect. The natural language request is to list bind functions containing 'p'. The expert's completion uses 'bind -l' to list all bind functions and 'grep p' to filter those containing 'p'. The LLM's version attempts to read from '/dev/null' and uses multiple unnecessary 'sed' commands. This approach does not align with the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Save first IP address of domain 'google.com' in 'address' variable and display it
LLM's completion: dig +short google.com @8.8.8.8 > address && cat address
Expert's completion: address=$(dig +short google.com | grep -E '^[0-9.]+$' | head -n 1) && echo $address
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion saves all IP addresses to a file named 'address' and then displays them using 'cat'. It does not specifically extract and assign the first IP address to a variable. The expert's completion uses variable assignment to capture only the first IP address directly and then display it with 'echo'. Therefore, the LLM's solution does not accurately fulfill the task of saving only the first IP address in a variable and displaying it."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all characters except ";" and digits from the string "  Hello world;876	  "
LLM's completion: sed's/[^0-9;]//g' <<< "  Hello world;876	  "
Expert's completion: echo '  Hello world;876	  ' | tr -cd ';0-9'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's command is incorrect due to a missing space between 'sed' and 's/'. The intention to use 'sed' for substitution is clear, but the syntax is wrong. Additionally, the expert's use of 'tr' with '-cd' is a simpler and more direct approach for this specific task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove leading and trailing spaces or tabs from "  Hello world!	  "
LLM's completion: echo -s "  Hello world!	  " | xargs
Expert's completion: echo '  Hello world!	  ' | sed -e 's/^[ \t]*//' | sed -e 's/[ \t]*$//'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `xargs`, which will remove leading and trailing spaces, but only when using `echo | xargs`, it might work if interpreted correctly by default shell settings. The expert's completion explicitly uses `sed` to remove both leading and trailing spaces or tabs, which is a more reliable approach for this task, especially considering various shell configurations."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove the last 3 characters from "987654321"
LLM's completion: cut -c1-26 "987654321"
Expert's completion: echo 987654321 | rev | cut -c 4- | rev
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion \'cut -c1-26 "987654321"\' attempts to cut characters from a file named "987654321" and is incorrectly trying to specify a range that is outside the string\'s length. It does not actually remove characters from the string \'987654321\'. The expert\'s completion correctly uses echo, rev, and cut to manipulate the string in the intended manner by first reversing the string, removing characters, and reversing it back.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print source of the file system containing current working directory.
LLM's completion: findmnt -n -o source -v /
Expert's completion: df . | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `findmnt` command to get the source of the filesystem for the root directory '/', which may not necessarily point to the current working directory. The expert's completion uses `df .`, which specifically targets the current directory, ensuring it is the source of the file system containing the current working directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all variables (names only) with names containing "H".
LLM's completion: declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -A H=0; declare -
Expert's completion: env | awk -F= '{if($1 ~ /H/) print $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not address the task. It repeats variable declarations and does not list variable names containing 'H'. The expert completion correctly uses `env` and `awk` to filter variable names."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print a list of unique users who are logged in
LLM's completion: users | sort | uniq
Expert's completion: who | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort | uniq
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `users` command, which shows the usernames of users currently logged in, but it may not handle sessions correctly and does not list unique users. The expert's completion uses `who` combined with `cut` to extract usernames, which is a more accurate approach for listing each unique user session and then sorting and filtering for uniqueness. Therefore, the LLM's solution is not entirely faithful as it may not reliably give unique users."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: ping 192.168.1.1
LLM's completion: ping 192.168.1.1
Expert's completion: ping -w 1 192.168.1.1
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's translation 'ping 192.168.1.1' is faithful to the natural language description, which simply asks to 'ping 192.168.1.1'. The expert added an optional parameter '-w 1' to set a timeout, but it is not required by the original task description. Thus, the LLM accurately captured the essence of the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print a line of 99 '=' characters
LLM's completion: printf=99=
Expert's completion: seq -s= 100|tr -d '[:digit:]'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion 'printf=99=' does not correctly implement printing a line of 99 '=' characters. It is missing correct syntax and structure to achieve the task. The expert's use of 'seq' and 'tr' accurately generates 99 '=' characters."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count number of users logged in
LLM's completion: who|wc -l
Expert's completion: who | awk -F' ' '{print $1}' | sort -u | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion ('who|wc -l') directly counts all lines output by `who`, which effectively counts all user sessions including duplicates. The expert's completion counts unique usernames by using `awk` and `sort -u`, which might be more accurate if a single user has multiple sessions. However, the LLM's approach still fulfills the basic requirement of counting logged-in users, so it can be considered faithful to the task, albeit less precise in certain scenarios."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Displays calendar of a previous, current and next month for December of 2120 year.
LLM's completion: cal 12 2120..1
Expert's completion: cal -3 12 2120
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM output `cal 12 2120..1` is incorrect as it uses an invalid range `..1` syntax. The expert's completion `cal -3 12 2120` correctly uses the `-3` option to display the calendar for the previous, current, and next months centered around December 2120. The LLM's attempt doesn't faithfully meet the task requirements."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Extract, sort and print only group names from /etc/group.
LLM's completion: sort -k 1,1 -u /etc/group | cut -d: -f1
Expert's completion: cut -d: -f1 /etc/group | sort
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion sorts the entire line first and attempts to remove duplicates (`-u` option), which can disrupt the order of group names. The expert's completion correctly extracts the group names first and then sorts them."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 10
LLM's completion: sum=0;for i in {1..10};do sum=$((sum+i));done;echo $sum
Expert's completion: seq 10 | jq -s 'add'
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful because it correctly computes the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop and prints the result. It matches the task description accurately."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of files and directories in the entire testbed directory
LLM's completion: find /home/parallels/testbed/ -maxdepth 1 -exec ls -l {} \; | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion counts the contents (files and directories) only at the top level of the specified directory because it uses `-maxdepth 1`, and involves an unnecessary use of `-exec ls -l`. The expert's completion correctly counts all the files and directories in the entire '/testbed' directory recursively."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the number of python files in the testbed directory.
LLM's completion: find testbed -iname "*.py" | wc -l
Expert's completion: find testbed -type f -name "*.py" | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion `find testbed -iname "*.py" | wc -l` is faithful to the task. It correctly uses `find` to search for files ending in `.py` and counts them with `wc -l`. The difference with the expert\'s completion is the use of `-iname` instead of `-name`, which allows for case-insensitive matching, but both achieve the task of counting Python files.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Sort the lines of textfile1.txt in reverse alphabetical order and save the result to a new file
LLM's completion: sort -r -f -o textfile1.txt.r textfile1.txt
Expert's completion: sort -r /testbed/dir1/textfile1.txt > /testbed/dir1/textfile1_reverse_sorted.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion faithfully sorts the lines in reverse order using `sort -r` and saves the result, although it uses `-f -o` options and a different file naming convention. The use of `-f` makes sorting case-insensitive, which is slightly different from the expert's (who may or may not have assumed case sensitivity). However, the essence of the task is preserved by sorting in reverse and saving to a new file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for all files containing the word 'Shell' in testbed.
LLM's completion: find testbed -iname "*shell*"
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec grep -l 'Shell' {} +
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion only searches for files with 'shell' in their names, which is case-insensitive due to the use of '-iname'. It does not search for files containing the word 'Shell' within the file contents. The expert's completion accurately searches within file contents for 'Shell'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find all symbolic links in the testbed directory.
LLM's completion: find testbed -type l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion 'find testbed -type l' is faithful to the task as it correctly uses the 'find' command to search for symbolic links ('-type l') in the specified 'testbed' directory. The only difference is the path given as 'testbed' instead of '/testbed', which affects starting directory path interpretation. However, both completions interpret the task accurately in terms of locating symbolic links."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Get the total size of all files in testbed/ and save it to total_size.txt
LLM's completion: du -h testbed/|tail -1|cut -d'' -f1>total_size.txt
Expert's completion: du -sh testbed/ | awk '{print $1}' > total_size.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `du -h` instead of `du -sh`, which lists all files and directories under `testbed/` with human-readable sizes, instead of just the total. Additionally, the `cut` command is incorrectly attempting to cut on an empty delimiter and will not work properly without a space or character to cut by. Therefore, it does not correctly capture the total size and write it to the file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all files in the directory /testbed/dir1 and sort them by size in human-readable format
LLM's completion: du -h /testbed/dir1/* | sort -rn -k1
Expert's completion: ls -lhS /testbed/dir1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `du -h`, which lists the disk usage for each file, and sorts by numeric values, not strictly by file size as `ls -lhS` would. The `du` command is more suited for checking used space, not direct file sizes, which might not align exactly with what `ls -lhS` provides. The sorting and output method is different as well, making it not faithful to the description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of lines in files under the directory /testbed/dir2.
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir2 -type f | xargs wc -l
Expert's completion: grep -rl . /testbed/dir2 | xargs wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions achieve the task of counting the number of lines in files under the directory /testbed/dir2.\n\n1. **LLM's completion**: `find /testbed/dir2 -type f | xargs wc -l`\n   - **Explanation**: It uses `find` to list all files in /testbed/dir2 and then pipes them to `xargs wc -l` to count the lines. This approach is valid and concise.\n\n2. **Expert's completion**: `grep -rl . /testbed/dir2 | xargs wc -l`\n   - **Explanation**: It lists all files recursively using `grep -rl` and then pipes them to `xargs wc -l` to count the lines. This is also valid but uses `grep` to list files, which is slightly unconventional compared to `find` for this task.\n\nBoth methods correctly achieve the goal of counting lines in all files within the specified directory. Therefore, the LLM's completion is considered faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the name and size of the 3 largest files in the directory /testbed/dir3
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir3 -type f -exec ls -s {} \; | sort -rn -k2 | head -n 3 | cut -d''-f2- | xargs -I {} ls -l {} | cut -d''-f5- | cut -d''-f1,2 | sort -k2 -rn | head -n 3
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir3 -type f -exec ls -lhS {} + | sort -rh -k5 | head -n 3
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's command is overly complex and incorrect in its attempt to replicate the sorting and listing operations. It uses redundant `ls` commands, leading to errors in parsing sizes and names, and does not achieve the intended result effectively. The expert's command directly uses `ls -lhS` and sorts by human-readable size correctly. The LLM's output does not faithfully achieve the task of printing the name and size of the 3 largest files, as it mishandles the sorting and listing operations."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find all files modified in the last 2 hours and compress them into a tarball named archive.tar.gz in the directory /testbed
LLM's completion: find /testbed -mtime -2 -print0 | tar -czf archive.tar.gz -
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -mmin -120 -print0 | xargs -0 tar -czf /testbed/archive.tar.gz
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-mtime -2`, which checks for files modified in the last 2 days, not 2 hours. The expert uses `-mmin -120`, which accurately finds files modified in the last 2 hours. Additionally, the LLM does not specify the directory for `archive.tar.gz`, whereas the expert explicitly places it in `/testbed/`. The expert's solution is correct and more precise in its implementation."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all subdirectories of /testbed that are not named subdir1
LLM's completion: find /testbed -maxdepth 1 -type d! -name subdir1
Expert's completion: ls -d /testbed/*/ | grep -v /subdir1/
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's command is incorrect due to a syntax error—it lacks a space between '-type d' and '!'. Additionally, it does not correctly exclude the directory named 'subdir1' because find requires space and '-name' should be preceded by find arguments."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for all files that contain the string 'text file' under the directory /testbed
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec grep -q 'text file' {} \; -print
Expert's completion: grep -r 'text file' /testbed
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `find` command to locate files and then `grep` to search for the string 'text file' in those files. This approach will effectively identify files containing 'text file' under the directory /testbed, which matches the task described. The expert's completion uses `grep -r` to recursively search for the string directly, which is more concise but both achieve the same end result."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Compute the MD5 hash of all files under the directory /testbed and store them in a file named hashes.txt in the same directory
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f | sort | xargs md5sum | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq > hashes.txt
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec md5sum {} + > /testbed/hashes.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation captures computing MD5 hashes, but has issues: 1) It uses `sort` and `uniq` which are not necessary for the task. 2) It doesn't store `hashes.txt` in the /testbed directory, leading to incorrect output location."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find all files in the directory /testbed that have been modified in the last 24 hours and print their path
LLM's completion: find /testbed -mtime -1
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -mtime -1 -print
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion lacks the `-type f` option, which ensures that only files are listed, excluding directories. Additionally, the LLM's completion does not explicitly include `-print`, though `find` defaults to printing paths, clarity and specificity are better achieved with `-print`."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for all the files in /testbed directory and its subdirectories that contain the word 'Hello' and replace it with 'Hi' in-place.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec sed -i's/Hello/Hi/g' {} \;
Expert's completion: grep -rl "Hello" /testbed | xargs sed -i 's/Hello/Hi/g'
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `find` command to locate files and `sed` to replace 'Hello' with 'Hi'. This is indeed a valid approach. While the method slightly differs from the expert's, both achieve the stated task. The LLM's completion is thus faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the contents of textfile3.txt and textfile4.txt side by side, with line numbers and a separator between them.
LLM's completion: git diff --no-color --side-by-side --line-numbers --separator=| textfile3.txt textfile4.txt
Expert's completion: paste <(nl /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt) <(nl /testbed/dir1/subdir1/textfile4.txt)
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `git diff` with `--side-by-side` and other options, which is not suitable for just displaying files side by side with line numbers and a separator. The `git diff` command is intended for comparing files, not simply displaying them side by side. The correct approach uses the `paste` command with process substitution, ensuring line numbers are added using `nl` and files are displayed side by side, which the expert's solution correctly applies."
