Natural Language Description: list files in the current directory
LLM's completion: find. -type f -name '*'
Expert's completion: ls
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `find` command, which lists all files in the directory and subdirectories. This is not faithful since it doesn't replicate the behavior of `ls`, which lists only the current directory's files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list all files in the current directory including hidden files
LLM's completion: find. -name '*' -print
Expert's completion: ls -a
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `find` command, which lists all files and directories recursively, not just in the current directory. It also does not specifically include hidden files unless configured differently. In contrast, the `ls -a` command correctly lists all files, including hidden ones, in the current directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: create a directory /testbed/test_dir
LLM's completion: sudo mkdir /testbed/test_dir
Expert's completion: mkdir /testbed/test_dir
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'sudo' which introduces an unnecessary requirement for elevated permissions that was not specified in the task. The expert's completion adheres to the task by creating the directory without 'sudo.'"
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print hello world
LLM's completion: echo 'hello world'
Expert's completion: echo hello world
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses the `echo` command to print 'hello world', matching the intent of the natural language description. The use of single quotes does not change the output in this context, so it is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the current user
LLM's completion: echo $USER
Expert's completion: whoami
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions correctly print the current user. The LLM's completion `echo $USER` retrieves the current user's name from the USER environment variable, while the expert's completion uses the `whoami` command to achieve the same result. Both methods are valid and fulfill the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: remove a directory named fake_dir
LLM's completion: rm -rf fake_dir
Expert's completion: rmdir fake_dir
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `rm -rf`, which forcefully removes the directory and its contents, while the expert's completion uses `rmdir`, which only removes empty directories. The natural language description didn't specify contents, so `rmdir` is more faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the first 5 lines of the setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh file
LLM's completion: cat setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | head -n 5
Expert's completion: head -n 5 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's translations will correctly display the first 5 lines of the file `setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh`. The LLM's version uses `cat` piped into `head`, while the expert's version uses `head` directly. Both achieve the same result, although the expert's solution is more efficient by using `head` directly on the file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the last 5 lines of the setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh file
LLM's completion: tail -5 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: tail -n 5 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's translations correctly use the `tail` command to display the last 5 lines of the file. In `tail -5`, the `-5` is a shorthand that functions the same as `-n 5`, so the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the tenth line of the setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: sed -n '10p' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: sed -n 10p setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful. Both the expert and the LLM use the `sed` command to print the tenth line, and the LLM's version is correct with the '-n' and '10p' options included, matching the expert's intent."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the path of the bash executable
LLM's completion: echo $(which bash)
Expert's completion: which bash
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion and the expert's completion achieve the task of printing the path to the bash executable. \n\nThe LLM's solution uses `echo $(which bash)`, which first finds the path using `which bash` and then prints it using `echo`. Although this adds an extra step, it is functionally equivalent to just using `which bash`, which directly prints the path as the expert's completion does. Therefore, the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system utilization stats
LLM's completion: sar -u
Expert's completion: vmstat
is_faithful=True explanation="Both `sar -u` and `vmstat` can be used to display system utilization statistics, particularly CPU usage. `sar` (System Activity Reporter) provides detailed CPU statistics, while `vmstat` (Virtual Memory Statistics) offers a broader overview including memory, CPU, and IO stats. The LLM's choice of `sar -u` is a reasonable alternative for obtaining system utilization data, specifically for CPU usage."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system load averages
LLM's completion: sysctl -a | grep'sysctl.net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control'
Expert's completion: w
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion retrieves TCP congestion control settings, not system load averages. The expert's completion uses the `w` command, which displays system load averages at the top of its output."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print running processes
LLM's completion: htop
Expert's completion: ps
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion ("htop") and the expert\'s completion ("ps") serve different purposes but relate to the same topic.\n\nThe command `ps` is a basic utility that lists running processes and is most directly faithful to the task as it simply displays the processes without any interactive features.\n\nThe command `htop`, while related to processes, opens an interactive process viewer with more features than just listing processes. It is not a direct translation of "print running processes" but rather a more advanced tool for viewing and managing them.\n\nTherefore, `htop` doesn\'t exactly match the simplicity and specificity of "print running processes," which `ps` achieves more directly.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print running processes in a tree format
LLM's completion: htop
Expert's completion: pstree
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion 'htop' does not directly fulfill the task as specified. 'htop' is an interactive process viewer that shows system processes in a dynamic, color-coded interface, but it does not specifically show processes in a tree format by default. On the other hand, 'pstree' directly addresses the requirement by displaying running processes in a tree structure, making the expert's completion more faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system memory usage
LLM's completion: free -m
Expert's completion: free
is_faithful=True explanation="Both 'free' and 'free -m' are command-line utilities to display the amount of free and used memory in the system. The flag '-m' in 'free -m' specifically displays the values in megabytes, which is a common and sensible way to present the data, particularly for human readability. Therefore, the LLM's completion is faithful to the task of printing system memory usage."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the kernel version
LLM's completion: cat /proc/version
Expert's completion: uname -a
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion outputs the kernel version along with other information, but it does not directly match the more precise and traditional way to get the kernel version, which is via `uname -r`. The expert chose `uname -a`, which prints all system information, including the kernel version. The LLM's approach also contains more information than just the kernel version, but the initial command `uname -r` would be more suitable for the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system IP address
LLM's completion: ip addr show | awk 'BEGIN{print "ip addr show"}; {print $2}'
Expert's completion: hostname -I
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to use `ip addr show` to list all network interfaces, and it incorrectly prints every second column using awk, including an unintended literal string 'ip addr show'. This does not directly print the system's IP address as intended.\n\nOn the other hand, the expert's completion directly uses `hostname -I` to output only the IP addresses, which is a cleaner approach for obtaining the system's IP address. The expert's version is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the ip addresses of the system DNS servers
LLM's completion: cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'
Expert's completion: cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. It not only identifies lines containing 'nameserver' but also extracts just the IP addresses using `awk`. The expert's completion lists the entire lines, which include the 'nameserver' keyword, followed by the IP address. Both solutions achieve the primary goal of accessing system DNS server IPs, with the LLM's completion providing a more precise output."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the network interfaces
LLM's completion: ip link
Expert's completion: ifconfig
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion `ip link` is indeed a valid command to display network interfaces on many Linux distributions. Similarly, `ifconfig` is another valid command for the same purpose, though it's considered somewhat deprecated in favor of `ip link` by some communities."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the routing table
LLM's completion: ip route
Expert's completion: route
is_faithful=True explanation="Both `ip route` and `route` can be used to display the routing table. `ip route` is part of the newer `iproute2` package and is widely adopted, while `route` is from the older `net-tools` package. The LLM's completion is faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: show the last logged in users
LLM's completion: who -r
Expert's completion: last
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion 'who -r' shows the runlevel, not the last logged in users. The expert's command 'last' correctly shows the list of recent logins."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the last logged in users and show the full user and domain names
LLM's completion: w -u
Expert's completion: last -w
is_faithful=False explanation="The command 'w -u' lists current logged-in users and uptime, which does not faithfully retrieve the last logged in users or show full user and domain names. In contrast, 'last -w' accurately shows the list of last logged-in users including their full user and domain names."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: base64 encode the string 'hello'
LLM's completion: echo "hello" | base64
Expert's completion: echo 'hello' | base64
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful. Both completions use the echo command to pass the string 'hello' to base64 for encoding. The difference in quotes (double vs single) does not affect the outcome in this context."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: base64 decode the string 'aGVsbG8='
LLM's completion: base64 --decode aGVsbG8=
Expert's completion: echo 'aGVsbG8=' | base64 -d
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion lacks the 'echo' command to pass the Base64 string to the 'base64' command. The expert's completion uses 'echo' to input the string to be decoded."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print lines containing 'console' in the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: grep "console" setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: grep 'console' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. Both the LLM and the expert use the `grep` command to search for lines containing the word 'console' in the specified file. The difference in quotation marks (double vs single) doesn't affect the outcome in this context."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list the stats and timestamps of the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: stat --format="%n %y %z" setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: stat setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion modifies the 'stat' command to specifically format the output to show the file name, modification time, and a custom placeholder ('%z'), which does not exist in 'stat' formatting options. This completion changes the outcome, potentially omitting other file statistics that the expert's completion would include. Therefore, it is not faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the current terminal type
LLM's completion: tput -T type
Expert's completion: echo $TERM
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `tput -T type`, which is incorrect for printing the current terminal type. The correct command to print the terminal type is `echo $TERM`, as provided by the expert. The `tput -T` option is typically used to specify a terminal type for capacity strings, not to display the current terminal type."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the current process priority
LLM's completion: ps -p pid -o nice
Expert's completion: nice
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion reads the nice value of a specific process using 'ps', but it requires a specific PID. The expert's completion, 'nice', is more appropriate, directly showing the priority of the command being run. The LLM's completion isn't faithful as it requires additional context (PID) and does not clearly display the current process priority unless a PID is supplied."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the pid of the current shell
LLM's completion: echo $!
Expert's completion: echo $$
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful to the task. The command `echo $!` displays the PID of the last background process, not the PID of the current shell. The expert's completion `echo $$` correctly displays the PID of the current shell."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the current user's groups
LLM's completion: groups $(whoami)
Expert's completion: groups
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. Both `groups` and `groups $(whoami)` effectively print the current user's groups. The use of `$(whoami)` explicitly specifies the current user, but the end result is the same."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list memory information
LLM's completion: echo $(awk '/MemTotal/ {print $2}' /proc/meminfo)
Expert's completion: lsmem
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful. It tries to extract the total memory using awk from /proc/meminfo, but it doesn’t provide comprehensive memory information. The expert's completion (using 'lsmem') provides detailed memory information, which is more aligned with the request to 'list memory information'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the installed ssh version
LLM's completion: ssh -v
Expert's completion: ssh -V
is_faithful=False explanation="The correct option to print the version of SSH is '-V'. The LLM's completion uses '-v', which is incorrect as it shows verbose mode information instead."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the bash profile in the home directory
LLM's completion: cat ~/.bash_profile
Expert's completion: cat ~/.bashrc
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is incorrect because it translates the request to print the bash profile as showing the '.bash_profile' file, whereas the expert's completion shows '.bashrc'. The natural language description is ambiguous since 'bash profile' could refer to different configuration files such as '.bash_profile' or '.bashrc'. Both are used in shell configuration, but '.bash_profile' is typically used for login shells. Without more context, neither can be definitively ruled out solely based on the description, but the expert's completion shows a different interpretation than the LLM's."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system's locale
LLM's completion: echo $LANG
Expert's completion: locale
is_faithful=False explanation="The expert's completion 'locale' prints all locale settings, while the LLM's completion 'echo $LANG' only prints the primary language setting. Thus, the LLM's version is not fully faithful to the task as it does not display the complete locale information."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: find all files larger than 100MB in the current dir
LLM's completion: find. -size +100M
Expert's completion: find . -size +100M -print
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is almost identical to the expert's completion, except it omits the '-print' action. In 'find' commands, '-print' is the default action if no other action is specified, so the LLM's output will still list all files larger than 100MB. Therefore, it is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: change the ownership of /testbed/test.txt to user 'nobody'
LLM's completion: sudo chown nobody /testbed/test.txt
Expert's completion: chown nobody /testbed/test.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion includes the use of 'sudo', which is often necessary for changing file ownership, especially when the user executing the command does not have the required permissions. This does not affect the faithfulness to the task since it fulfills the same purpose as the expert's command."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: change the group of /testbed/test.txt to group 'nogroup'
LLM's completion: sudo chgrp nogroup /testbed/test.txt
Expert's completion: chgrp nogroup /testbed/test.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. Both the LLM's and the expert's translations use the `chgrp` command to change the group of the specified file to 'nogroup'. The only difference is that the LLM includes `sudo`, which may be necessary to ensure proper permissions for changing the group, depending on the user's privileges. This addition does not detract from faithfulness; it can be considered an enhancement for handling permission issues."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: change permissions of /testbed/test.txt to read-only for everyone
LLM's completion: chmod -R a-r /testbed/test.txt
Expert's completion: chmod 444 /testbed/test.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the flag '-R' which applies the command recursively to directories and files within them. Moreover, '-a-r' removes the read permissions instead of setting them to read-only. The expert's completion correctly sets permissions to read-only for all users."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: count the lines, words, and characters in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: wc -l setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: wc setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion only counts the lines due to the `-l` flag. It doesn't count words and characters, which is specified in the natural language description. The expert's completion, `wc setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh`, correctly counts lines, words, and characters."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the unique lines in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: uniq -u setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: uniq setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `-u` option with `uniq`, which only outputs lines that are not repeated anywhere in the file. The expert's translation correctly uses `uniq` without options, which outputs all unique lines, whether repeated or not."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display network statistics
LLM's completion: sudo netstat
Expert's completion: netstat --statistics
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion 'sudo netstat' runs the netstat command with superuser privileges but does not specifically show detailed network statistics. The expert's completion 'netstat --statistics' correctly uses the --statistics option to display comprehensive network details. Therefore, the LLM's completion is not faithful to the task description as it lacks the specific statistics flag."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display network interfaces
LLM's completion: ip link show
Expert's completion: netstat -i
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `ip link show`, which displays network interfaces and their details. It is an accurate way to display network interfaces. The expert's completion uses `netstat -i`, an older command that also displays network interfaces. Both achieve the same goal using different tools, and the LLM's completion is faithful to the task by modern standards."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: show running daemons and services
LLM's completion: systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
Expert's completion: service --status-all
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion using `systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running` shows running services managed by systemd. However, this does not cover all running daemons and services, especially in systems where services may not be managed by systemd. The expert's completion, `service --status-all`, is more inclusive, as it attempts to show all services, although the format might vary. The task requires a comprehensive view of all running daemons and services, which the LLM's output does not fully achieve."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system boot time
LLM's completion: cat /proc/stat | grep boot_time
Expert's completion: who -b
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'cat /proc/stat | grep boot_time', which is incorrect because the 'boot_time' is not present in /proc/stat. The correct command to print the system boot time is 'who -b' as given in the expert's completion."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print a list of active kernel parameters
LLM's completion: sudo sysctl -a
Expert's completion: sysctl -a
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion and the expert's completion use the sysctl command to list kernel parameters. The LLM's version includes 'sudo', which adds elevated permissions, but this does not change the command's faithfulness to listing active kernel parameters."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list the installed software packages
LLM's completion: pacman -Ss
Expert's completion: dpkg --get-selections
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `pacman -Ss`, which is a command to search for packages in the Arch Linux package database, not to list installed packages. The expert's completion `dpkg --get-selections` correctly lists all installed packages on Debian-based systems."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list available shells
LLM's completion: zsh -l
Expert's completion: cat /etc/shells
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion 'zsh -l' executes a login shell with zsh, which doesn't list the available shells. The expert's completion 'cat /etc/shells' correctly lists available shells as this file contains the paths of all the available shell binaries on the system."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list all users on the system
LLM's completion: getent passwd | cut -d: -f1
Expert's completion: getent passwd
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. It uses `getent passwd` to retrieve the list of users and then uses `cut` to extract only the usernames, which aligns with the request to list all users. It adds an extra step to isolate usernames, making it precise in listing user names only."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: extract the filename from this path '/usr/local/bin/my_script.sh'
LLM's completion: echo '/usr/local/bin/my_script.sh' | awk -F/ '{print $NF}'
Expert's completion: basename /usr/local/bin/my_script.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's solutions achieve the same outcome: extracting the filename 'my_script.sh' from the given path. The LLM uses `awk` to print the last field based on '/' as a delimiter, which effectively extracts the filename in the same way as `basename`. Hence, the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: extract the directory from this path '/usr/local/bin/my_script.sh'
LLM's completion: echo '/usr/local/bin/my_script.sh' | sed -e's/\/[^\/]*$//'
Expert's completion: dirname /usr/local/bin/my_script.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `sed` to remove the last part of the path (which corresponds to the file name), effectively extracting the directory. This approach is different from using `dirname` (as in the expert's solution), but it achieves the same result and is therefore faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: send the message 'System maintenance in 10 minutes!' to all logged in users
LLM's completion: wall "System maintenance in 10 minutes!"
Expert's completion: wall 'System maintenance in 10 minutes!'
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task as it correctly uses the `wall` command to send the specified message to all logged-in users. The use of double quotes instead of single quotes has no impact on the execution in this context."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the contents of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh with lines wrapped to 40 characters
LLM's completion: cat setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | wrap | head
Expert's completion: fold -w 40 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `wrap` and `head`, which are not standard commands for line wrapping in Bash. The expert's completion uses `fold -w 40`, which correctly wraps lines to 40 characters."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print all system configuration variables
LLM's completion: printenv
Expert's completion: getconf -a
is_faithful=False explanation='The task requires printing all system configuration variables. The expert uses `getconf -a`, which lists system configuration variables. However, the LLM uses `printenv`, which displays environment variables, not system configuration variables.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the max cpu time
LLM's completion: echo $(echo "scale=2; $(echo $(( $(awk 'BEGIN {print 1e9}' ) - $(awk 'BEGIN {print 1e9}' ) ) / $(echo $(( $(awk 'BEGIN {print 1e9}' ) - $(awk 'BEGIN {print 1e9}' ) ) * 1000000 ) ) | bc -l) * 1000000" | bc -l)
Expert's completion: ulimit -t
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful. It gives a convoluted command involving arithmetic and string manipulations that do not relate to 'max CPU time.' The expert's command 'ulimit -t' directly refers to the 'max CPU time' set for the shell, which is the correct interpretation."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the configured size of long integers
LLM's completion: echo $(getconf LONG_MAX)
Expert's completion: getconf LONG_BIT
is_faithful=False explanation="The task is to display the size of long integers, which is determined by how many bits are used to store them. The expert's completion `getconf LONG_BIT` correctly retrieves the number of bits used for a long integer. The LLM's completion `echo $(getconf LONG_MAX)` retrieves the maximum value a long integer can hold, not the size in bits. Therefore, the LLM's response is not faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the number of times the word 'the' appears in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: grep -o "the" setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | wc -l
Expert's completion: grep -o 'the' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion accurately uses `grep` with the `-o` option to count each occurrence of the word 'the' in the file, and then uses `wc -l` to count the lines, effectively counting the occurrences. The double quotes used in LLM's completion do not affect the correctness in this context."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the number of files in the current directory
LLM's completion: ls -l | wc -l
Expert's completion: ls -a | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion 'ls -l | wc -l' counts the total number of lines output by 'ls -l', which includes lines for each file as well as a header line. This means the count is off by one for each directory listing.\n\nThe expert's completion 'ls -a | wc -l' includes hidden files (dot files) and correctly counts all the lines produced by 'ls -a', representing the number of files, including hidden ones, in the directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print first line of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: echo $(cat setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | head -n1)
Expert's completion: sed -n '1p' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions will correctly print the first line of the file `setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh`. The LLM's approach uses `cat` in combination with `head -n1`, while the expert's solution uses `sed` to print the first line directly. Both accomplish the same task effectively."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the last line of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: tail -n 1 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: sed -n '$p' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation='Both the LLM\'s completion "tail -n 1 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh" and the expert\'s completion "sed -n \'$p\' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh" correctly print the last line of the file \'setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh\'. They use different methods, but both achieve the same outcome, making the LLM\'s completion faithful to the task.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print lines 3 to 5 of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: cat setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | sed -n '3,5p'
Expert's completion: sed -n '3,5p' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `cat` to output the file contents and then pipes it into `sed`, whereas the expert solution directly uses `sed`. Both solutions correctly use `sed -n '3,5p'` to print lines 3 to 5 of the file. However, the use of `cat` is unnecessary. Despite this, the LLM's solution is functionally equivalent to the expert's and therefore faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print every other line of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: cat setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | awk 'NR%2==0'
Expert's completion: sed -n '1~2p' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation prints every even-numbered line (lines 2, 4, 6, ...) due to 'NR%2==0', but the task requires printing every other line starting from the first line. The expert's completion correctly uses '1~2p' in `sed` to print lines 1, 3, 5, etc."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: find all empty files in the current directory, do not search sub directories
LLM's completion: find. -empty -type f -exec rm -f {} \;
Expert's completion: find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -empty
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion searches for empty files but then removes them, which is not part of the task. It also does not restrict the search to the current directory only, i.e., without considering subdirectories. The expert's completion correctly finds all empty files in the current directory without removing them and restricts the search with `-maxdepth 1`."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print lines in the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh that are less than 20 characters
LLM's completion: cat setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | grep -E "^\S{1,20}"
Expert's completion: awk 'length < 40' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `grep -E` with the pattern `^\\S{1,20}` which checks for lines that start with 1 to 20 non-whitespace characters, not lines with a total length of less than 20 characters. It does not accurately filter lines based on total length. The expert's completion correctly uses `awk` to filter lines with a `length` less than 20."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print lines in the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh that contain the characters 'the' and 'a'
LLM's completion: grep -E 'the.*a' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: grep 'the' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | grep 'a'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the pattern 'the.*a', which matches lines where 'the' precedes 'a' in the same line. It doesn't necessarily match lines that contain 'the' and 'a' separately in any order. The expert's translation correctly uses two separate grep commands to ensure that lines containing both 'the' and 'a' are matched, regardless of their order."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the sha512 digest of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: sha512 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: sha512sum setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the command 'sha512', which is not a standard command for calculating SHA-512 digests. The correct command to use for displaying the SHA-512 digest of a file in bash is 'sha512sum', as shown in the expert's completion."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: encrypt the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh using the aes-256-cbc algorithm with password 'password' and save it to out.enc
LLM's completion: openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh -out out.enc -pass pass:password
Expert's completion: openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh -pass pass:password -out out.enc
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses the `openssl enc` command with the `-aes-256-cbc` algorithm, specifies the input file with `-in`, specifies the output file with `-out`, and provides the password using `-pass pass:password`. This matches the expert's completion and fulfills the given task accurately."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: create a file named 'world.txt' with the text 'hello' inside
LLM's completion: echo "hello" > world.txt
Expert's completion: echo 'hello' > world.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion and the expert's completion achieve the task of creating a file named 'world.txt' with the text 'hello' inside. The use of double quotes instead of single quotes in the echo command does not affect the output in this context."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system's public ip address
LLM's completion: curl -s ip.me
Expert's completion: curl ipinfo.io/ip
is_faithful=True explanation="Both commands use an external service to retrieve the public IP address. The LLM's completion uses 'ip.me', while the expert uses 'ipinfo.io/ip'. Both accomplish the task of retrieving the system's public IP address, making the LLM's completion faithful to the task despite the different service used."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate a list of duplicate md5 sum hashes for all the ".java" files in the /testbed directory
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.java' | xargs md5sum | sort | uniq -d
Expert's completion: md5sum /testbed/*.java | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -d
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `xargs`, but is missing a step to isolate md5 hashes only. The expert's uses `awk` to extract only the hashes before sorting and checking for duplicates. Thus, the LLM's version will not correctly identify duplicates by hash alone."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of the md5 sum of all the files under /testbed/dir2/subdir2 sorted by filename
LLM's completion: echo $(find /testbed/dir2/subdir2 -type f | sort -t/ -k5,5 | xargs -I{} md5sum {} | awk '{print $1}' | sort | xargs md5sum)
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir2/subdir2 -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 md5sum | awk '{print $1}' | md5sum
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not faithfully replicate the task because:\n\n1. It does not handle filenames with spaces or special characters correctly. \n2. It sorts by the 5th field using '/' as a delimiter, which may not be appropriate for all file paths.\n3. It includes an additional sorting step before calculating the second md5 sum, which is not specified in the task.\n\nThe expert's version handles these issues appropriately, especially by using `-print0` with `xargs -0` to correctly process filenames with spaces."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of the contents of the sorted list of files "$FILES"
LLM's completion: sort "$FILES" | xargs md5sum
Expert's completion: cat $(echo $FILES | tr ' ' '\n' | sort) | md5sum
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `xargs md5sum`, which calculates the MD5 sum for each file separately after sorting the list, rather than calculating the MD5 sum for the concatenated contents of the sorted files. The expert's completion uses `cat` to concatenate the contents of the sorted files into a single stream before calculating its MD5 sum, which matches the natural language description provided."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of the sorted list of md5 sums of all ".py" files under /testbed/dir1/subdir1
LLM's completion: echo $(find /testbed/dir1/subdir1 -name '*.py' | xargs -I{} md5sum {} | sort | cut -d''-f1 | xargs -I{} echo $(find /testbed/dir1/subdir1 -name '*.py' | xargs -I{} md5sum {} | sort | cut -d''-f1 | xargs -I{} echo $(find /testbed/dir1/subdir1 -name '*.py' | xargs -I{} md5sum {} | sort | cut -d''-f1 | xargs -I
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir1/subdir1 -type f -name *.py -exec md5sum {} + | awk '{print $1}' | sort | md5sum
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion contains multiple errors and redundancies. It attempts to repeatedly nest the same operations, leading to a malfunctioning command. It incorrectly uses redundant nested `find` and `xargs` commands, which causes syntax and logical errors. The expert's completion correctly finds all '.py' files, computes their md5 sums, sorts them, and finally calculates the md5 sum of the sorted list, whereas the LLM's completion does not execute correctly or perform the desired task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the total disk usage for each ".txt" file on the /testbed directory and prepend the system host name to the output
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.txt" -exec du -h {} \; | xargs -I {} echo -n $(hostname)'' {}
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.txt" -exec du {} + | awk -v hostname="$(hostname)" '{print hostname, $0}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `du -h` which includes human-readable sizes, potentially altering the numerical order. Additionally, it outputs the hostname without spacing and uses `echo -n` which suppresses the newline, leading to incorrect output formatting. The expert solution uses `awk` to ensure correct host name formatting and preserves file size calculation."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Change permissions for all PHP files under the /testbed directory tree to 755 and print the number of files changed
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' -exec chmod 755 {} \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" -exec chmod 755 {} \; -exec /bin/echo {} \; | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion correctly changes permissions for all PHP files under the /testbed directory to 755. However, it lacks the part of the command that prints the number of files changed, which is done in the expert's completion using `-exec /bin/echo {} \\; | wc -l` to count the files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Check if the current shell is running within a 'screen' process and print "True" or "False"
LLM's completion: shuf -i 0-1 -n 1 | xargs -I {} echo "{}" | grep -q screen && echo "True" || echo "False"
Expert's completion: pstree -s $$ | grep -q "screen" && echo "True" || echo "False"
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `shuf` to randomly select between 0 and 1, which does not check if the current shell is running within a 'screen' process. The expert's completion uses `pstree` to check the process hierarchy, which is the correct approach to determine if 'screen' is in the process tree."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print "True" if the contents of file /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt is a subset of file /testbed/dir2/subdir1/textfile2.txt, otherwise print "False"
LLM's completion: echo $(cat /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt | grep -f /testbed/dir2/subdir1/textfile2.txt)
Expert's completion: comm -23 <(sort /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt | uniq) <(sort /testbed/dir2/subdir1/textfile2.txt | uniq) | head -1 | grep -q '.' && echo "False" || echo "True"
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `grep -f`, which checks if any lines from textfile3.txt are in textfile2.txt but doesn't ensure that all lines from textfile3.txt are present. The expert's completion correctly checks if the whole content of textfile3.txt is a subset by using `comm` to compare sorted and unique lines, ensuring true subset checking. The LLM's method can result in a false 'True' if only some lines match."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Compute the mean average of the word count of *.txt files in the /testbed directory
LLM's completion: mean $(cat /testbed/*.txt | wc -w)
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.txt' -print0 | xargs -0 wc -w | awk 'END { print $1/(NR-1) }'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion computes the total word count of all .txt files and then attempts to calculate the mean using an undefined 'mean' function, rather than counting the words in each file separately and then averaging them. The expert's completion correctly finds each file, counts words individually, and calculates the average accordingly."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Compute the mean average of the word count of *.txt files smaller than 6 words in the /testbed directory
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -name '*.txt' -size +0 -size -6c | xargs wc | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum/NR}'
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.txt' -print0 | xargs -0 wc -w | awk '$1 < 6 {v += $1; c++} END {print v/c}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion focuses on file size rather than word count, misinterpreting the task. The correct solution involves checking word count and averaging only those with less than 6 words, which the expert's completion does correctly."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Copy all files with "FooBar" in the path under the '/testbed' directory to the '/testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp' directory.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*FooBar*' -exec cp {} /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -path '*FooBar*' -print0 | xargs -0 -I{} cp -r {} /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion achieves the same result as the expert's completion by using 'find' to locate files with 'FooBar' in their names and then copying them to the target directory. Both solutions effectively identify and copy the matching files, fulfilling the task requirements."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for all .txt files in the /testbed directory, prints their paths, and then search within each file for the word "another"
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.txt" | xargs -I {} echo "Searching in {}"; grep -i "another" {}
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.txt" \( -exec echo {} \; -o -exec true \; \) -exec grep another {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion uses `xargs` and `grep` incorrectly. It attempts to search for the word \'another\' with `grep -i "another" {}` outside the `xargs` command, which is syntactically incorrect and won\'t execute properly. Additionally, the use of `echo` does not follow through to the `grep` command, leading to incorrect results. The expert solution correctly executes `echo` to print paths and then searches within each file using `grep` in a single execution flow.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Convert the first 16 characters in "/testbed/textfile7.txt" to a single hexadecimal value
LLM's completion: xxd -p -l 16 /testbed/textfile7.txt
Expert's completion: head /testbed/textfile7.txt -c16 | od -tx1 -w16 | head -n1 | cut -d' ' -f2- | tr -d ' '
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's command `xxd -p -l 16 /testbed/textfile7.txt` does not convert the first 16 characters to a single hexadecimal value; instead, it converts the first 16 bytes to plain hex bytes, without aggregating them into a single value. The expert's command processes the bytes into a single continuous hexadecimal string."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Copies all files under the /testbed folder like "file.txt" with "FooBar" in the path to the root of the current folder, preserving mode, ownership and timestamp attributes.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*FooBar*file.txt' -exec cp -p {}./ \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -path '*FooBar*' | xargs -i cp -p "{}" .
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the 'find' command with '-name '*FooBar*file.txt'', which looks for files with 'FooBar' and 'file.txt' in the name. However, it does not correctly separate the conditions as needed. Also, there's a missing space between '{}' and './' in the 'cp' command. The Expert's completion correctly uses '-type f' and '-path '*FooBar*'' to identify the files, then uses 'xargs' to handle copying with preservation of mode, ownership, and timestamp."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Copy all files and folders below the /testbed directory whose names contain "FooBar" to directory '/testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp'
LLM's completion: cp /testbed/*FooBar* /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*FooBar*' -print0 | xargs -0 -I{} cp -R {} /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `cp` command with a wildcard, which only copies files from the top level of `/testbed` and does not include directories. It also doesn't recursively search within subdirectories as required, nor does it ensure copying of directories. The expert's completion, by using `find` with `xargs`, recursively searches and copies all matching files and directories below `/testbed`."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count all the lines of all '*.c' files in /testbed directory recursively
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.c' | xargs wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.c" -print0 | xargs -0 cat | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM’s and the expert’s scripts aim to count the lines of all '*.c' files in the specified directory. The LLM's solution uses `wc -l` directly on each file, which correctly counts lines of each file separately and collectively provides a summary. The expert’s version concatenates all files first before counting lines, but both ultimately count all lines in '*.c' files. Thus, the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count all the lines of all files with names ending with 'php' in current directory and subdirectories recursively
LLM's completion: find. -name '*php' -exec wc -l {} \; | awk '{sum+=$1} END {print sum}'
Expert's completion: find . -type f -name '*php' | xargs cat | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's command uses `find` to locate files with names ending in 'php', then `wc -l` to count lines for each file individually, and finally `awk` to sum these counts and print the total. This effectively counts all lines as required, although it processes each file separately.\n\nThe expert's command also uses `find` to locate 'php' files, then `cat` to concatenate their contents, followed by `wc -l` to count the lines, yielding a total line count. This approach is slightly different but ultimately achieves the same outcome.\n\nBoth commands correctly fulfill the task of counting all lines in '.php' files recursively in the current directory and its subdirectories."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count all the lines of all php files in the /testbed directory recursively
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" | xargs wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed/ -name '*.php' | xargs cat | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly finds all PHP files under the /testbed directory and counts the lines using 'wc -l', albeit in a slightly different way from the expert's completion. It uses xargs to pass file names to 'wc -l', which processes them individually, whereas the expert uses 'cat' to concatenate the files before counting the lines with 'wc -l'. Both achieve the same result, counting lines across all PHP files recursively."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5sum of all '*.py' files in /testbed folder and sub folders.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.py' -exec md5sum {} \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -name "*.py" -exec md5sum {} +
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses `find` to locate all `*.py` files in the `/testbed` directory and subdirectories, and uses `-exec md5sum {} \\;` to calculate the MD5 checksum for each file. This achieves the same end result as the expert's completion, making it faithful to the task. The difference in `-exec` syntax (using `+` vs `\\;`) does not affect the task's correctness here, although using `+` can be slightly more efficient."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the *.html files residing in the /testbed directory tree and containing string "foo"
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.html' | xargs grep -c "foo"
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.html" | xargs grep -l foo | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion uses `grep -c`, which counts the number of occurrences of "foo" within each file, whereas the task requires counting the number of files containing the string "foo". This difference leads to a count of occurrences instead of files. The expert\'s completion correctly uses `grep -l` to list files and `wc -l` to count them, aligning with the task description.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of files/directories with '.php' extension under /testbed directory tree and change the permissions to 755
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' | wc -l; find /testbed -name '*.php' -exec chmod 755 {} \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" -exec chmod 755 {} \; -exec /bin/echo {} \; | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion and the expert's completion achieve the task of counting the number of '.php' files and changing their permissions to 755. The difference is in the approach: \n\n1. **LLM Approach**: The files are counted first, and then their permissions are changed in a separate command.\n2. **Expert Approach**: The permissions are changed first, and as each file is echoed, it's piped and counted.\n\nBoth methods are valid and achieve the same end result."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of lines in all files in the /testbed directory tree that match pattern '*file*'
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*file*' | xargs wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed/ -name '*file*' | sort | xargs wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion effectively counts the number of lines in files matching the pattern '*file*' in the /testbed directory tree. The expert's addition of `sort` is not required for the main task of counting lines. The core functionality is preserved in the LLM's version."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of regular files in directory tree ${DIRECTORY} that contain a vowel in their names
LLM's completion: find ${DIRECTORY} -type f | grep -E '[aeiou]' | wc -l
Expert's completion: find ${DIRECTORY} -type f -print | sed -e 's@^.*/@@' | grep '[aeiouyAEIOUY]' | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion effectively counts files containing any vowels (aeiou) in their names by using `find` to locate files, `grep -E` to filter them by vowel presence, and `wc -l` for counting. It appropriately fulfills the task described in the prompt. The Expert's solution includes 'y' and uppercase vowels, but this wasn't specified as necessary in the prompt description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of files for each unique file extensions in the /testbed directory tree.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f | xargs -I {} echo -n {} | grep -oE '\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f | sed -e 's/.*\.//' | sed -e 's/.*\///' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to extract file extensions using `grep -oE '\\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+'`, which looks for any dot followed by alphanumeric characters, assuming they are extensions. However, it will include the dot as part of the extension and may produce incorrect results if files do not follow this pattern strictly. \n\nThe expert's solution correctly removes everything before the last dot to get the extension, using `sed -e 's/.*\\.//'`, and it also ensures that slashes are removed with `sed -e 's/.*\\///'`. This approach is more robust and accurately counts extensions by isolating them correctly."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the total number of lines in all "*.gz" files in the /testbed directory tree after decompression
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.gz' | xargs gzip -dc | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -name '*.gz' | xargs zcat | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="Both commands aim to count lines in '*.gz' files after decompression.\n\n1. The LLM's use of `gzip -dc` effectively decompresses the files, similar to `zcat` used by the expert.\n2. They both use `find` to locate '*.gz' files within the /testbed directory.\n3. `xargs` is utilized in both to handle multiple files.\n4. `wc -l` is consistently employed to count the lines.\n\nThe LLM's approach is technically sound and performs the required task accurately."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count lines in each *.php file sorted by file in /testbed directory.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' | xargs wc -l | sort -k1 -n
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' -type f | sort | xargs wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM and expert solutions use the `find` command to search for '*.php' files in the `/testbed` directory and then count the lines using `wc -l`. The expert sorts the files before counting with `sort`, whereas the LLM sorts by line count afterwards using `sort -k1 -n`. The LLM's approach is more focused on sorting the output by the number of lines, rather than strictly sorting files first. However, the solution still adheres to the overall task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts lines in each *.php file in /testbed directory, sorted by number of lines, descending.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' | xargs wc -l | sort -nr
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' -type f | xargs wc -l | sort -nr
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. Both the LLM and the expert versions use 'find' to locate '*.php' files in the '/testbed' directory. They both count the lines using 'wc -l' and sort the results in descending order with 'sort -nr'. The expert version includes '-type f' to restrict the search to regular files, which is a more precise approach but does not change the fundamental task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts number of occurences of all ip addresses in '/etc/networks' file, and prints all addresses with number of occurences in a descending order.
LLM's completion: grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' /etc/networks | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
Expert's completion: grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' /etc/networks | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly captures the task of counting the occurrences of IP addresses in the '/etc/networks' file and printing them in descending order of frequency. The only difference is the switch order '-rn' in the LLM's output versus '-nr' from the expert, which does not change the correctness of the sorting in descending order."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts total number of only lines with alphanumeric symbols in all *.php files in the /testbed folder and subfolders.
LLM's completion: grep -c '[a-zA-Z0-9]' /testbed/*.php

is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion only counts alphanumeric lines in '*.php' files directly inside the /testbed folder, but does not include subfolders. Additionally, it uses 'grep -c' which counts files, not lines. The expert's completion correctly searches recursively through folders and counts lines with alphanumeric symbols in all relevant files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts total lines in PHP and JS files in /testbed.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" -o -name "*.js" | xargs wc -l

Natural Language Description: Create an empty file "abc.txt" in each directory named "dir1" under testbed directory.
LLM's completion: find testbed -name dir1 -exec touch dir1/abc.txt \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type d -name "dir1" -print |  sed 's/$/\/abc.txt/g' | xargs touch
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful to the task. It attempts to use the 'find' command to locate directories named 'dir1' within 'testbed', but it incorrectly uses 'dir1/abc.txt' as a relative path. This will always target the current located directory to look for 'dir1' but won’t flexibly append 'abc.txt' correctly across all 'dir1' directories found. \n\nThe expert's completion correctly constructs the path dynamically by appending '/abc.txt' to each located directory and uses 'xargs touch' to create the file in each directory. This approach is correctly generalized and will work for multiple directories named 'dir1' inside 'testbed', something the LLM’s solution fails to accomplish."

Expert's completion: find /var/log/ -mtime +1 | xargs  tar -czvPf  /testbed/logs.tar.gz
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation modifies the task with additional options such as --exclude-vcs and --exclude-from=logs.exclude, and uses a different approach to specify the log files, involving awk and specific filename patterns, which is not mentioned in the original description. The expert version sticks closer to the original description by using find to locate files older than one day, then passing them directly to tar to create the archive, without additional exclusions or filename filtering."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Delete files in "/testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp" that are older than 2 days
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp -type f -mtime +2 -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp -type f -mtime +2 -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `find` command to locate files older than 2 days and deletes them, which is consistent with the task. It uses the `-exec` option with `rm` to remove the files, which achieves the intended outcome, albeit with a different approach than using `xargs`. Both methods are valid and faithful to the described task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the 5 largest files in the /testbed directory and its sub-directories.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec ls -S {} \; | head -5
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec du -b {} + | sort -rh | head -n 5
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation uses `ls -S`, which sorts files by name, not size, when used with `find`. The expert uses `du -b` and `sort -rh` to accurately determine file sizes and sort them from largest to smallest, then selects the top 5."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the 5 smallest files in the /testbed directory and its sub-directories ignoring any empty files.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -size +0c | xargs du | sort -n | head -n 5
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -size +0c -exec du -b {} + | sort -n | head -n 5
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM’s solution correctly finds files larger than 0 bytes, uses `du` to get their sizes, sorts them numerically, and lists the top 5 smallest files. This matches the expert's approach in functionality."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the 5 smallest files in the /testbed directory and its sub-directories.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -printf "%s %p\n" | sort -n | head -n 5
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec ls -s {} \; | sort -n  | head -5
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion correctly identifies the smallest files by size and limits the number to 5. However, using `-printf "%s %p\\n"` directly with `find` is an efficient method to list file sizes and paths without needing to execute an additional command like `ls`. This can be considered more efficient and faithful as it involves fewer system calls.\n\nThe expert’s method uses `ls -s` inside `find -exec`, which also lists file sizes and sorts them to get the smallest files. Both methods achieve the same end goal but use slightly different approaches.\n\nHowever, considering typical faithfulness to precise task requirements in real scenarios, both solutions should account for non-human-readable bytes rather than blocks, for precise sorting of file size. The expert\'s code interprets size as the number of 512-byte blocks that the file takes, while the LLM\'s solution interprets it as bytes, adhering to a more typically expected behavior in finding the smallest files by size in most real-world applications.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the five biggest file sizes only in the /testbed directory
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec ls -l {} \; | awk '{print $5}' | sort -nr | head -n 5
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -maxdepth 1 -exec du -b {} + | sort -rh | head -n 5
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion retrieves the file sizes using `ls` and sorts them based on size, but it fails to limit the search to just the files in `/testbed`, potentially including files from subdirectories. The expert's completion uses `du -b` which directly calculates the size and restricts the depth to avoid subdirectories (`-maxdepth 1`). This ensures it only includes files directly in `/testbed` and is more faithful to the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find .java files in the testbed directory tree that contain 'Hello', and print their names
LLM's completion: find testbed -name "*.java" | grep "Hello"
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.java" -exec grep -Hin Hello {} + | cut -d ":" -f 1 | xargs -I{} basename {}
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `grep` to filter through the paths produced by `find`, but this will not check the contents of the files themselves. Instead, it will only search for the text 'Hello' in the paths of .java files, not within the files. The expert solution correctly uses `-exec grep` to search within each .java file for the string 'Hello'. Therefore, the LLM's completion is not faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print a list of all duplicate case insensitive filenames in the /testbed directory tree
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.txt' | sort | uniq -c | awk 'NR>1{print $2" "$1}'
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f | awk -F/ '{print $NF}' | sort -f | uniq -i -d
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion searches only for files ending with '.txt' instead of all files, doesn't handle case insensitivity correctly, and does not specifically target duplicates. The expert version correctly extracts filenames, sorts them case-insensitively, and identifies duplicates."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print all unique file paths under "testbed/dir1" compared to "testbed/dir2"
LLM's completion: find testbed/dir1 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I{} find testbed/dir2 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{} -I{}
Expert's completion: comm -23 <(find /testbed/dir1 | sed 's#/testbed/dir1/##' | sort) <(find /testbed/dir2 | sed 's#/testbed/dir2/##' | sort) | sed 's#^#/testbed/dir1/#'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation uses a complex and incorrect pipeline involving `xargs` and multiple `-I{}` flags. This approach does not achieve the task of finding unique file paths in 'testbed/dir1' that are not in 'testbed/dir2'. The expert's solution correctly identifies unique paths by comparing the sorted lists of files from both directories.\n\nThe expert's use of `comm` with sorted paths effectively isolates unique entries, while the LLM's method lacks a coherent logic to achieve the required comparison."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively finds all files containing text 'Hello' in /testbed and prints folder where they are placed.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec grep -l 'Hello' {} \; | xargs -I {} echo {}
Expert's completion: grep -rl 'Hello' /testbed | xargs -I {} dirname {} | sort | uniq
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation finds files containing 'Hello' but simply echoes the filenames, which does not fulfill the requirement of printing the folders. The expert's solution correctly extracts the directory names and ensures unique folder listing by using `dirname` and `uniq`."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Prints total number of lines of all *.java files in /testbed folder and subfolders.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.java" | xargs wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.java' -print0 |xargs -0 wc -l|grep 'total' |awk '{ print $1 }'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion lists the line count for each file but does not ensure it prints only the total count. It lacks the filtering and summing steps provided by the expert's completion, such as the use of `grep` and `awk` to isolate and print just the total number of lines across all files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a symbolc link in the /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/FooBar to root folder
LLM's completion: ln -s /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/FooBar/ /
Expert's completion: ln /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/FooBar -s /
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion places the symbolic link inside the directory `/testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/FooBar/` pointing to the root folder, but the expert's completion aims to create a symbolic link to the root folder at the location `/testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/FooBar`. The syntax of the LLM's command is incorrect for creating a symbolic link in the specified location."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for all the files in the folder /testbed/dir1 which have sticky bit set and have the permissions 553
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir1 -perm -553 -exec ls -l {} \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir1 -perm 1553
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-perm -553`, which looks for files that have at least 553 permissions, ignoring the sticky bit specifically. Additionally, the command unnecessarily includes `-exec ls -l {} \\;`. The expert's completion correctly uses `-perm 1553` to specifically check for files with the sticky bit (indicated by the leading '1') and 553 permissions, aligning exactly with the requirement."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for php files in /testbed directory and search for "world" in all these files
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" | xargs grep "world"
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' -exec grep -iq "world" {} \; -print
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `xargs grep` which will not handle filenames with spaces correctly, whereas the expert's solution uses `-exec` which is more robust and directly searches each file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively finds all files with any cased text "Hello" in the '/system/folder1' folder, and precedes found string with its number in file.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -name "*hello*" -exec sed -i's/hello/hello 1/g' {} \;
Expert's completion: grep -inr "Hello" /system/folder1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'find' and 'sed' to search for and modify the files, but it only matches lowercase 'hello' and does not accurately replace the string with a numbering system. It also modifies the files, which is not part of the original task. The expert's completion uses 'grep' to search recursively for the string 'Hello' with any case and shows its line number, which is closer to displaying 'preceding string' as mentioned in the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively finds all files with whole word "foo" in the '/system', and precedes found string with its number in file.
LLM's completion: grep -r 'foo' /system | awk '{print NR" " $0}'
Expert's completion: grep -rnw /system -e "foo"
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's command does not match the requirement to find whole words; it matches any line containing 'foo', not just the whole word. Additionally, it doesn't modify files but outputs line numbers prefixed to the matching lines. The expert's command uses the `-w` flag in `grep`, which specifically searches for whole words, and the `-n` flag includes the line number in the output, aligning with the task better."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively list contents of the '/system' directory in a tree-like format
LLM's completion: find /system -name '*' -print
Expert's completion: tree /system
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'find', which lists files but doesn't produce a tree-like format. The expert's use of 'tree' directly addresses the requirement for a tree-like format."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively print all files and directories in the '/system/folder2' directory tree including hidden files
LLM's completion: find /system/folder2 -print
Expert's completion: tree -a /system/folder2
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion using `find /system/folder2 -print` will list all files and directories recursively, but it does not include hidden files unless they are specifically targeted by using a pattern like `-name '.*'`. The expert's completion using `tree -a /system/folder2` includes the `-a` flag which ensures that hidden files are also printed. Therefore, the LLM's output is not completely faithful as it misses hidden files by default."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively prints all folders in the '/system' folder that contain files like "*.out".
LLM's completion: find /system -type d -name "*.out"
Expert's completion: find /system -type f -name "*.out" -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 dirname | sort -u
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion searches for directories named '*.out', whereas the task is to find folders containing files with the '*.out' extension. The expert's completion correctly finds files and prints their containing directories."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all "*.txt" files in the '/system' folder and answer "y" to any prompt
LLM's completion: rm -rf /system/*.txt
Expert's completion: yes y | rm -r /system/*.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion 'rm -rf /system/*.txt' forcefully removes files without prompting for confirmation. The expert's completion 'yes y | rm -r /system/*.txt' ensures that 'y' is automatically provided to any prompts. The LLM's solution skips this interaction step, changing the intended behavior."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively removes all empty folders under /system/folder3/temp, printing info message on each operation, and suppressing error messages if folder is not empty.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -type d -empty -exec rm -rf {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -type d -empty -exec rmdir -vp --ignore-fail-on-non-empty {} +
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `rm -rf`, which forcefully removes directories and their contents, not adhering to the requirement to only remove empty folders. The expert's completion uses `rmdir -vp --ignore-fail-on-non-empty` which correctly handles only empty directories, prints info messages, and suppresses errors for non-empty ones."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively removes all files in the /system/folder1 folder but '*txt' files.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -type f! -name '*txt' -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -type f -not -name '*txt' | xargs rm
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion has a syntax error due to missing whitespace after '-type f!' and before '-name'. Additionally, the LLM's command attempts to directly execute 'rm', but the expert's approach using 'xargs' can be more reliable with a large number of files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively rename all files under /system/folder2 replacing special with regular.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder2 -name "special*" -exec rename's/special/regular/' {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder2 -type f -name '*special*' ! -path '*/special/*' -execdir bash -c 'mv "$0" "${0/special/regular}"' {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the 'rename' command with incorrect syntax and pattern matching. It looks for files starting with 'special', but doesn't handle renaming correctly. Additionally, it may not recurse into directories. The expert's solution explicitly filters for files, properly constructs the rename operation using 'mv', and ensures directory recursion and pattern matching are handled properly."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively search for "foo" in the '/system' folder and write the output to the console followed by the number of matched lines
LLM's completion: find /system -name foo -print0 | xargs -0 grep -l -H "foo" | xargs -I{} echo "{}"
Expert's completion: grep -r "foo" /system | tee >(wc -l)
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'find' to search for the file named 'foo', and then uses 'grep' to search within these files, which is incorrect. It does not directly search for the content 'foo' in all files within '/system.' The expert's solution directly uses 'grep -r' to search for 'foo' in the content of files and uses 'tee' to display and count the number of matched lines. Therefore, the LLM's completion does not faithfully represent the task described."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively search for all regular files below directory "/system/folder3/", and output the name of each, without any containing directories.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder3/ -type f -name '*.*' -printf "%f\n"
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/ -type f -exec basename {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation='Both the LLM\'s and the expert\'s completions correctly achieve the task of listing all regular files recursively below the specified directory and outputting only their names, without any directory paths. The LLM\'s completion uses `-printf "%f\\n"` to print just the file name, which matches the task description. Therefore, it is faithful.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively unzip files to stdout in "/system/folder2.tar.gz" and search for "special"
LLM's completion: tar -xvf /system/folder2.tar.gz | grep -i special
Expert's completion: zcat -r /system/folder2.tar.gz | grep "special"
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `tar -xvf` which extracts files to the filesystem instead of sending output to stdout. It also ignores recursion and case-insensitivity was added, which wasn't specified. The expert's use of `zcat -r` correctly unzips to stdout and includes recursive search inherently."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove "\r" at the end of each line in "system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt" and display the result as printable characters or backslash escapes
LLM's completion: cat system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt | tr -d "\r"
Expert's completion: cat /system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt | sed 's/\r$//' | od -c
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion removes the '\\r' character from each line, but it does not display the content as printable characters or backslash escapes as required. It simply removes the '\\r' characters and outputs the plain result. The expert's completion additionally uses 'od -c' to display the content as printable characters or backslash escapes, which fulfills the requirement more accurately."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.doc files from the /system/folder1 tree
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -name '*.doc' -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -name '*.doc' -exec rm "{}" \;
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion is faithful to the task. The use of `{}` in the `-exec rm {}` portion of the command is synonymous with `"{}"` used by the expert. Both variations correctly handle filenames and perform the task of removing all `.doc` files from the `/system/folder1` directory tree.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.log files from the /system/folder1 tree
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -name '*.log' -exec rm -f {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -name '*.log' -print0 | xargs -0 rm
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `find` command to search for all files with the `.log` extension within the `/system/folder1` directory and its subdirectories, and then removes them using the `-exec rm -f` option, which is a correct and standard way to achieve the task. Although the methods differ slightly, both effectively fulfill the task of removing all `.log` files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.txt files in '/system' directory but not in it's subdirectories
LLM's completion: find /system -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.txt' -exec rm -f {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system -name '*.txt' -maxdepth 1 | xargs rm
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses `find` with `-maxdepth 1` to only consider files in the '/system' directory, excluding subdirectories, and specifies the `-type f` option to ensure only files are targeted. The `-name '*.txt'` filters for '.txt' files, and `-exec rm -f {} \\;` effectively removes them. This is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.sql files in the '/system/folder3/backup_dbg' directory that were last modified more than 25 days ago
LLM's completion: find /system/folder3/backup_dbg -name '*.sql' -mtime +25 -exec rm -f {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/backup_dbg/*.sql -mtime +25 -exec rm -f {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. It correctly uses the `find` command to locate `.sql` files in the specified directory that were last modified more than 25 days ago and removes them. The use of `-name '*.sql'` in the LLM's version allows it to search for `.sql` files specifically, while `-exec rm -f {} \\;` removes them, effectively achieving the same result as the expert's completion."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.txt files under the /system/folder1 directory modified more than 5 minutes ago
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -name '*.txt' -mmin +5 -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -mmin +5 -type f -name "*.txt" -delete
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses the `find` command to search for files in the `/system/folder1` directory with a `.txt` extension that were modified more than 5 minutes ago, using `-mmin +5`. It then uses the `-exec rm {} \\;` option to remove them, which is a valid approach and functionally equivalent to the expert's use of the `-delete` option. Both achieve the same result."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.txt files, except "keep.txt", under /system/folder1 directory modified more than 5 minutes ago. Do not include subdirectories.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -mtime +5 -type f! -name "keep.txt" -name "*.txt" -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -maxdepth 1 -mmin +5 -type f -name "*.txt" ! -name "keep.txt" -delete
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion uses `-mtime +5` instead of `-mmin +5`, which checks the modification time in days rather than minutes. It also incorrectly places `!` before `-name "keep.txt"`, which should negate only `keep.txt`. Additionally, it mishandles the name checking logic by not ensuring the \'*.txt\' condition is applied correctly. The `-exec rm` part in LLM\'s completion is correct but verbose compared to `-delete`, but the main issue is the time comparison unit.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all .sh files in the '/system/folder1' tree whose names begin with "new"
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -name 'new*.sh' -exec rm -f {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -name 'new*.sh' -exec rm -f '{}' \;
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. The command `find /system/folder1 -name 'new*.sh' -exec rm -f {} \\;` effectively finds and removes all `.sh` files in the `/system/folder1` directory tree that start with 'new'. The use of `{}` directly in the command (without surrounding quotes) is a minor syntactic variation that does not impact the correctness or execution of the command."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all a.out, *.o, and core files under the '/system' directory
LLM's completion: find /system -name 'a.out' -or -name '*.o' -or -name 'core' | xargs rm -f
Expert's completion: find /system \( -name a.out -o -name '*.o' -o -name 'core' \) -exec rm {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions correctly utilize the 'find' command to locate 'a.out', '*.o', and 'core' files under the '/system' directory.\n\nDifferences:\n- The LLM's completion uses 'xargs rm -f' to remove the files, chaining the 'find' output to 'rm'.\n- The expert's completion uses '-exec rm {} \\;' directly with 'find' to remove each found file immediately.\n\nBoth methods effectively achieve the same result in this context, making them faithful implementations of the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the last five lines of /system/folder1/data.csv
LLM's completion: tail -5 /system/folder1/data.csv
Expert's completion: cat /system/folder1/data.csv | rev | cut -d, -f-5 | rev
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion 'tail -5 /system/folder1/data.csv' correctly prints the last five lines of the specified CSV file. The expert's completion appears incorrect as it tries to manipulate the columns instead of lines, likely a misunderstanding. Therefore, the LLM's bash command is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all directories called "temp" from the /system directory tree
LLM's completion: find /system -type d -name "temp" -exec rm -rf {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system -name "temp" -type d -delete
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion and the expert's completion aim to remove directories named 'temp' within the '/system' directory tree. The LLM's use of '-exec rm -rf {} \\;' is a standard method to execute the removal of directories, importing the same effect as the expert's use of '-delete'. Both approaches target directories with the specified name and are equivalently effective."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all empty files in /system/folder3/temp and below
LLM's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -type f -empty -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -type f -empty -print | xargs rm -f
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` to search for empty files in the specified directory and immediately removes them using `-exec rm {} \\;`. This approach is faithful to the task of removing empty files, just like the expert's version, which uses `xargs` to achieve the same result. Both effectively delete empty files in `/system/folder3/temp` and its subdirectories."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all files a.out and *.o in the /system directory tree that were modified less than 7 days ago
LLM's completion: find /system -name 'a.out' -or -name '*.o' -mtime -7 -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system \( -name a.out -o -name '*.o' \) -mtime -7 -exec rm {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses `find` to search for files named 'a.out' or matching '*.o' that were modified less than 7 days ago. The `-or` operator is equivalent to `-o`, and the `-exec rm {} \\;` part correctly removes the files. Therefore, the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all files and directories under '/system/folder3/temp' directory tree that match with one of the name patterns '.DS_Store', '._.DS_Store' , '._*', '.TemporaryItems' or '.apdisk'
LLM's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -name '.DS_Store' -o -name '._.DS_Store' -o -name '._*' -o -name '.TemporaryItems' -o -name '.apdisk' -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/temp \( -name '.DS_Store' -or -name '._.DS_Store' -or -name '._*' -or -name '.TemporaryItems' -or -name '.apdisk' \) -exec rm -rf {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not include '-rf' with 'rm', which is necessary to remove directories as well as files. Without '-rf', the command may fail to remove directories, making it less faithful to the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove everything within parentheses and substitute all non digit characters with a space from "1/2 [3] (27/03/2012 19:32:54) word word word word 4/5" and format the output as a table
LLM's completion: echo "1/2 [3] (27/03/2012 19:32:54) word word word word 4/5" | sed's/\([^0-9]\)/\1 /g; s/\([^)]\+\)//g' | column -t

is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not faithfully execute the task for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. The sed command `s/\\([^0-9]\\)/\\1 /g;` is incorrect. It attempts to capture non-digit characters and append a space, but uses incorrect syntax that will not produce the desired output.\n\n2. The parenthesis removal part `s/\\([^)]\\+\\)//g` doesn't properly target substrings within parentheses; instead, it removes everything outside the parentheses.\n\n3. The LLM's sed syntax lacks proper spacing and options to address line-gap formatting.\n\nThe expert's completion correctly removes content within parentheses and substitutes non-digit characters with spaces."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove files text2, text3, text4 in directory /system/folder1
LLM's completion: rm -rf /system/folder1/text2 text3 text4
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -name 'text[2-4]*' -exec rm {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion will only remove 'text2' in '/system/folder1', and incorrectly attempts to remove 'text3' and 'text4' from the current directory instead of '/system/folder1'. It lacks the necessary directory structure to ensure all files are targeted correctly, unlike the expert's use of 'find' to specifically target files 'text2', 'text3', 'text4' in '/system/folder1'. The LLM's use of '-rf' is inappropriate and unnecessary for removing individual files and could be dangerous."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove files that are less than 1KB in size under /system directory
LLM's completion: find /system -size -1k -exec rm -f {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system -type f -size -1k -exec rm {} +
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses '-exec rm -f {} \\;' which forcibly removes files and runs 'rm' for each file individually. The expert's version uses '-exec rm {} +' which removes files without forcing and is more efficient because it passes multiple files to 'rm' at once. The LLM's version also lacks the '-type f' option to ensure only files are targeted."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print "/system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt" without newline characters.
LLM's completion: echo "/system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt"
Expert's completion: paste -sd "" /system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The description asks to print the contents of the file without newline characters. The LLM's completion prints the file path as a string, not the contents of the file. The expert's completion uses `paste` to remove newlines from the file's contents, which is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove regular files in the /system directory tree
LLM's completion: find /system -type f -exec rm -f {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system -type f -exec rm {} +
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion and the Expert's completion accurately identify and remove regular files within the /system directory tree using the 'find' command with '-type f'. \n\nThe difference lies in the use of the '-exec' option:\n- The LLM uses '-exec rm -f {} \\;': This executes 'rm -f' for each file found, one at a time.\n- The Expert uses '-exec rm {} +': This executes 'rm' on all files at once, which can be more efficient.\n\nBoth commands will effectively remove regular files, so the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print amount of space available on the file system containing path to the /system directory in megabytes.
LLM's completion: df -h /system | awk 'NR==2 {print $4/1024}'
Expert's completion: df -m /system
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `df -h` which shows the available space in a human-readable format (auto select units), and then attempts to divide the space by 1024 in `awk`, which is incorrect. `df -m` used by the expert directly gives the result in megabytes, which is accurate and more efficient for this task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Archive all files in /system/folder1 directory modified in the last 60 days to "/mytarfile.tgz" with a time of 2023-01-01, owner of 0, and group of 0.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -mtime 60 -exec tar -czf /mytarfile.tgz {} \;
Expert's completion: tar --mtime='2023-01-01' --owner=0 --group=0 -czf mytarfile.tgz `find /system/folder1 -mtime -60`
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'find' with '-mtime 60', which selects files modified exactly 60 days ago, not within the last 60 days. Moreover, it doesn't set the mtime, owner, or group parameters for the tar file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Write the current date and time followed by " 1" to the console and append to "/system/folder3/temp/empty.txt"
LLM's completion: echo "$(date)" "1" >> /system/folder3/temp/empty.txt
Expert's completion: echo $(date) "1" | tee -a /system/folder3/temp/empty.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion directly appends the output to the file, while the expert's completion also writes it to the console using 'tee'. The LLM's version does not fulfill the part of the task that requires writing the output to the console."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Concatenate all .txt files residing in the /system tree into a single file "/system/folder3/temp/concat.txt"
LLM's completion: cat $(find /system -name "*.txt") > /system/folder3/temp/concat.txt
Expert's completion: find /system -name "*.txt" -not -name "concat.txt" -print -exec cat {} \; > /system/folder3/temp/concat.txt
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion accurately captures the task of finding all .txt files in the /system directory and concatenating them into /system/folder3/temp/concat.txt. However, the LLM\'s version does not specifically exclude "concat.txt". If there were a risk of "concat.txt" already existing in the search directory, this would lead to different outcomes, but assuming it\'s not present initially, the LLM\'s solution is faithful for one-time tasks.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Compresses all the files in the /system folder with default depth to /backup using cpio.
LLM's completion: find /system -type f -exec cpio -oav /backup {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system -depth -print | cpio -dump /backup
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-exec cpio -oav /backup {}` which attempts to execute `cpio` for each file found, leading to incorrect usage. The expert's version correctly uses `find` piped to `cpio -dump` to compress all files, as specified, with the default depth."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Copy all files in the /system directory except those containing 'text' to '/system/folder3/backup_dbg/backup'. Do not include subdirectories.
LLM's completion: find /system -name '*text*' -prune -o -name '*' -exec cp -t /system/folder3/backup_dbg/backup {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system -maxdepth 1 -type f ! -name '*text*' -exec cp {} /system/folder3/backup_dbg/backup \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not restrict the search to the top level of the /system directory, as it does not use the '-maxdepth 1' option, which means it could include files from subdirectories. Additionally, the '-prune' and '-name' usage results in a command that does not correctly exclude files containing 'text' or accurately achieve the task goals."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Dump "/system/text1.txt" as ASCII characters
LLM's completion: cat /system/text1.txt | xxd -p
Expert's completion: od -t c /system/text1.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `xxd -p` which outputs the file in a plain hexdump, showing hexadecimal pairs separated by spaces, not ASCII characters. The expert's completion uses `od -t c`, which correctly interprets each byte in the file as an ASCII character."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a compressed archive of /system/folder1 "compress_folder1.tar.gz" with a time of 2023-01-01, owner of 0, and group of 0.
LLM's completion: tar -czf /system/compress_folder1.tar.gz --mtime 2023-01-01 --owner 0 --group 0 /system/folder1
Expert's completion: tar --mtime='2023-01-01' --owner=0 --group=0 -zcf compress_folder1.tar.gz /system/folder1
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's response correctly translates the natural language description into a bash command. It uses the correct flags for setting the modification time (--mtime), owner, and group. The archived file is named and compressed as specified and contains the correct directory (/system/folder1). The path for the output file is absolute (/system/compress_folder1.tar.gz), aligning with a possible interpretation of the task, though the expert did not do so. The overall functionality is retained."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: download content from "http://example.com/textfile.txt" and output to 'textfile.txt' in /system
LLM's completion: download -o /system/textfile.txt http://example.com/textfile.txt
Expert's completion: curl http://example.com/textfile.txt -o /system/textfile.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's use of 'download' is incorrect as there is no built-in 'download' command in bash. The correct command for downloading files from URLs in a bash shell is typically 'curl' or 'wget'. The expert solution using 'curl' is accurate and commonly used for such tasks."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search in /system downwards all files whose size is greater than 10 bytes.
LLM's completion: find /system -size +10
Expert's completion: find /system -size +10c -print
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `find /system -size +10` is incorrect because it does not specify the unit as bytes. The `-size +10` would use the default block size (usually 512 bytes) rather than bytes, leading to incorrect results. The expert solution `find /system -size +10c -print` correctly specifies `+10c` to represent bytes and includes `-print` to display the results."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5sum of each ".txt" file under "/system" and sort the output.
LLM's completion: find /system -name "*.txt" | xargs md5sum | sort
Expert's completion: find /system -type f -name '*.txt' -exec md5sum {} + | awk '{print $1}' | sort
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. It correctly uses `find` to locate all .txt files under the `/system` directory, applies `md5sum` to each file, and sorts the output. The key operations match the natural language description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for the system host name in "/etc/hosts" and print the IP address in the first awk field
LLM's completion: awk -F'''$1 ~ /system/ {print $2}' /etc/hosts | awk '{print $1}'
Expert's completion: more /etc/hosts | grep `hostname` | awk '{print $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to use awk to find a 'system' entry, but it doesn't correctly identify or incorporate the system's host name, nor does it use the correct field. The expert's completion correctly uses `hostname` to obtain the system's hostname and then searches for it in '/etc/hosts' before printing the IP address using `awk '{print $1}'`."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find files in /workspace directory modified within 30 days.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -mtime -30 -print
Expert's completion: find /workspace -daystart -type f -mtime -30
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion `find /workspace -mtime -30 -print` achieves the desired task, as it searches for files modified within the last 30 days in the `/workspace` directory. The key option `-mtime -30` is present, which is essential for filtering files modified within 30 days. The expert's version includes additional parameters like `-daystart` and `-type f`, which refine the search to start counting from the beginning of the current day and to include only files (not directories). The core functionality is maintained in the LLM's completion, making it faithful to the task, though perhaps not as precise as the expert's version."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: find files in the /workspace directory with pattern` *.c  that larger than 1 Kilobytes
LLM's completion: find /workspace -name "*.c" -size +1k
Expert's completion: find /workspace -name '*.c' -size +1k -print
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses the `find` command to locate files in the `/workspace` directory that match the pattern `*.c` and are larger than 1 Kilobyte. The `-print` option in the expert's completion is often the default behavior for `find`, so both commands effectively perform the same primary task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find files in the /workspace directory and sub-directories, that changed over an hour ago.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -mmin +60
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -cmin +60
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses '-mmin' which checks for last modification time, whereas the task requires checking files that have 'changed' over an hour ago, which refers to '-cmin' (status change time). The expert's completion correctly uses '-cmin'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find files in the /workspace directory and sub-directories, that were accessed over an hour ago.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -atime +3600
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -amin +60
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-atime +3600`, which checks files accessed more than 3600 days ago, not an hour. The expert's completion correctly uses `-amin +60` to specify files accessed more than 60 minutes ago, which is equivalent to an hour."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list all the files in the /workspace directory which are of size 0 bytes.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -size 0 -type f -print
Expert's completion: find /workspace -empty
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find /workspace -size 0 -type f -print`, which specifically searches for files of size 0 bytes in the /workspace directory. This is a faithful representation of the task described.\n\nThe expert's completion, `find /workspace -empty`, also finds zero-byte files but would find empty directories too if they are present. However, since the task specifies files, the LLM's approach is more precise in fulfilling the requirement by ensuring that it considers files only."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list all zero-length files under the /workspace directory
LLM's completion: find /workspace -size 0 -print
Expert's completion: find /workspace -empty -exec ls {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses the `find` command to locate zero-length files by specifying `-size 0`, which accurately identifies files of size zero bytes. The LLM's inclusion of `-print` ensures that these file paths are output, aligning with the task of listing them. This approach is faithful to the task as it achieves the same end result, although with a different method than using `-empty` in the expert's completion."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: locate and remove large files (> 1 KB) in /workspace
LLM's completion: find /workspace -size +1024 -exec rm -f {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -size +1k -delete
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. Both solutions use the `find` command to locate files in the '/workspace' directory that are larger than 1 kilobyte and remove them. The difference is that the LLM uses `-size +1024`, where `1024` bytes equates to 1 kilobyte, and `-exec rm -f {} \\;` to delete the files. The expert uses `-size +1k` and `-delete`. While the expert's completion is more concise, the LLM's uses a slightly different method that achieves the same result."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all the files in the /workspace directory which have only read permission to the group.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -perm g=r -type f
Expert's completion: find /workspace -perm 400 -type f -exec ls -l {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `-perm g=r` option, which matches files where the group permissions exactly match 'read'. However, this does not ensure that it's the only permission for the group, as the description specifies 'only read'. The expert's solution specifically reflects reading files with '400' (user read-only) and verifies group permissions by listing files with `ls -l` to check manually."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all the files in the /workspace directory which have permissions 777.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -perm 777 -type f -print
Expert's completion: find /workspace -perm 777 -type f -exec ls -l {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `find` command with the `-perm 777` option to search for files in the `/workspace` directory that have 777 permissions. It employs `-type f` to ensure only files are considered, and `-print` to output the file names. The expert's solution additionally uses `-exec ls -l {} \\;` to give a detailed listing (including permissions, owner, size, etc.) for each file found. However, both interpretations meet the basic requirement of identifying files with 777 permissions; thus, the LLM's completion is considered faithful as it fulfills the primary task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List the details of all the text files in /workspace directory.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -name "*.txt" -exec ls -l {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -name "*.txt" -exec ls -ld {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion lists the details of all text files, as does the expert's. Both use the `find` command to locate text files and `ls -l` to display their details, with the `-l` flag providing a detailed list. The use of `-d` in the expert's completion is not necessary for the task of listing files within a directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: move all files in the /workspace folder to / and do not move the files in the sub folder
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -not -path '/workspace/*' -exec mv {} / \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec mv -t / {} +
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-not -path '/workspace/*'`, which incorrectly matches no files because it excludes all files within '/workspace', including those at the top level. It does not achieve the task intent to move only top-level files, as no files will be moved. \n\nThe expert uses `-maxdepth 1` to restrict the search to the top-level files, ensuring only these are moved, excluding any subfolder content."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Move files in /workspace accessed less than one day ago to directory /.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -mtime -1 -type f -exec mv {} / \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -atime -1 -type f -exec mv {} / \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-mtime`, which checks for files modified less than one day ago, instead of `-atime`, which checks for files accessed less than one day ago. Thus, the LLM's version does not faithfully follow the task's requirement which specifically mentions access time."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print all filenames of files under /workspace/dir1 dir containing 'hello', case-insensitive
LLM's completion: find /workspace/dir1 -type f -name '*hello*' -print
Expert's completion: find /workspace/dir1 -type f -exec grep -il 'hello' {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the '-name' option, which only matches filenames and doesn't search within file contents. The expert's completion correctly uses 'grep' with '-i' for case-insensitive searches within files, which aligns with the task of finding files containing 'hello', case-insensitively."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print disk usage of files or folders in /workspace
LLM's completion: du -h /workspace/*
Expert's completion: du -sh /workspace
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion, `du -h /workspace/*`, lists the disk usage of each file and folder individually in the /workspace directory, while the expert's completion, `du -sh /workspace`, provides the total disk usage of the entire /workspace directory. The LLM's response is not fully faithful because it outputs each item's usage separately rather than a total for /workspace."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the last word in /workspace/dir1/long.txt
LLM's completion: cat /workspace/dir1/long.txt | awk '{print $NF}'
Expert's completion: tac /workspace/dir1/long.txt | awk 'NF{print $NF; exit}'
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion achieves the goal of printing the last word of each line by using `awk` with `{print $NF}`, which prints the last field of each line. Although the LLM's approach differs from the expert's method, it still meets the task's requirement within each line."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the 3 largest directories in /workspace.
LLM's completion: du -ah /workspace | sort -nr | head -n 3
Expert's completion: du -a /workspace | sort -nr | head -n 3
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `-h` flag which makes the sort command interpret human-readable sizes. However, it can affect precision in determining the largest directories if sizes are too close. The expert's version avoids this potential issue by omitting the `-h` flag, making it more reliable for precise sorting of disk usage sizes."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: prints first line of "/workspace/dir1/long.txt"
LLM's completion: cat /workspace/dir1/long.txt | head -n1
Expert's completion: head -n1 /workspace/dir1/long.txt
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion is faithful to the task. Both the LLM\'s and the expert\'s commands will correctly print the first line of the file "/workspace/dir1/long.txt". The LLM\'s use of `cat` before `head` is not necessary for this specific task, but the outcome is the same.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: prints the last non-empty line of "/workspace/dir1/a.txt"
LLM's completion: cat /workspace/dir1/a.txt | tail -n1
Expert's completion: tac /workspace/dir1/a.txt | grep -m 1 '.'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion (`cat /workspace/dir1/a.txt | tail -n1`) prints the last line of the file, regardless of whether it is empty or not. The expert's completion (`tac /workspace/dir1/a.txt | grep -m 1 '.'`) correctly reverses the file content, finds the first non-empty line, and prints it. Therefore, the LLM's translation is not faithful to the task as it does not ensure the line is non-empty."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: prune all the files in the /workspace directory
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -delete
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. It uses `find` to locate all files (`-type f`) in the /workspace directory and then uses `xargs` with `rm -f` to delete them. The expert's solution is more concise, directly using the `-delete` option, but both achieve the same result of removing all files from the directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for all the files in the  /workspace directory which have size greater than 1KB (approx) and less than 32KB(approx).
LLM's completion: find /workspace -size +1K -size -32K
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -size +1k -size -32k
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is missing the '-type f' option, which ensures only files are selected, excluding directories and other types of filesystem objects. The expert's version more accurately matches the natural language description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for all the files in the  /workspace folder and sort them in the order of their depth and display the file names
LLM's completion: find /workspace -name '*' | sort -u -k 2
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f | awk -F/ '{print NF, $0}' | sort -n
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `sort -u -k 2`, which is intended to sort uniquely but does not sort by depth. It also searches for any file or directory with `-name '*'`, but does not specify files only with `-type f`. The expert's solution uses `awk` to count the slashes and `sort -n` to order files by depth accurately."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for all the files in the /workspace folder which are bigger than 1KB and display the biggest file.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -size +1k | xargs du -sh | sort -rn | head -1
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -size +1k -exec ls -ls {} + | sort -n | tail -1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `xargs du -sh` which computes the disk usage of each file, but not directly comparable with the direct `ls -ls` output. Additionally, the use of `sort -rn` changes the order to reverse numerical, differing from sorting by size. The expert's solution directly lists and sorts files by size to determine the biggest file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for text files in the  /workspace folder which do not have write access to others
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -perm -444 -name '*.*'
Expert's completion: find  /workspace -type f \( -iname "*.txt" -not -perm -o=w \)
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's command searches for any file type with read permissions for everyone, not specifically text files without write access for others, as required by the description. The expert's command correctly filters for text files that do not have write access for others."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for the directory "mysql" in the workspace directory.
LLM's completion: find ~/workspace -name "mysql"
Expert's completion: find  /workspace -name mysql -type d
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion searches for any file or directory named "mysql" within the `~/workspace` directory, whereas the expert\'s completion specifies searching for directories (`-type d`) named "mysql" in `/workspace`. The LLM missed limiting the search to directories and used a different search path.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print a list of all duplicate case insensitive filenames in the /workspace directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f | xargs -I{} shuf -n 2 <(echo {} | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') | sort -u | uniq -d
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f | awk -F/ '{print $NF}' | sort -f | uniq -i -d
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's command is not faithful to the task. The use of `shuf` and `xargs` does not address finding duplicate filenames and is conceptually incorrect. The expert's command appropriately finds files, extracts filenames, sorts them case-insensitively, and identifies duplicates."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for the file old2.txt in the /workspace folder and list its permissions and creation time.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -name old2.txt -exec ls -l {} \; -exec date -r {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -name old2.txt | xargs ls -tl
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation doesn't accurately obtain the creation time of the file. The `date -r` command shows the last modification time, not the creation time. The expert's completion doesn't retrieve creation time either, but uses a simpler approach by listing the details with `ls -tl` which includes modification time in a formatted list. Neither solution accurately retrieves the file's creation time specifically, but the LLM's method included an incorrect interpretation of the time requirement."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for the word "hello" in all the regular/normal files in the  /workspace folder and display the matched file name
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec grep -i "hello" {} \;
Expert's completion: find  /workspace -type f | xargs grep -l "hello"
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion does not perform the task as specified. It searches for the word "hello" and prints matching lines from all files, not just the filenames containing the match. It also uses `-i` to ignore case without specification and lacks `-l`, which ensures only filenames are displayed.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of all files in the /workspace directory with the filename printed first
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec md5sum {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec md5sum {} + | awk '{print $2 " " $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion generates the md5 sum of each file in the /workspace directory, but it does not reorder the output to print the filename first. The expert's completion uses awk to adjust the output format to match the task requirement."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of all files in directory tree "/workspace"
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec md5sum {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion accurately calculates the md5 sum of all files in the directory tree "/workspace" by using the `find` command. It does so by finding all files (-type f) and executing the `md5sum` command on each one. The omission of `| sort` from the expert\'s version does not affect the faithfulness to the original natural language description, as it does not mention sorting the output.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of unique 3 to 6 character file extensions are in the /workspace directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -name '*.[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,6}' | sort -u | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -name '*.*' | awk -F. 'NF>1 {ext=tolower($NF); if (length(ext) >= 3 && length(ext) <= 6) print ext}' | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation looks for files with extensions using a regex pattern in the `-name` option of `find`, which is not supported. This doesn't correctly filter file extensions of lengths 3 to 6. The expert's translation processes extensions and counts only those that match the criteria. "
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a copy of the /workspace directory structure in the /usr directory,
LLM's completion: cp -r /workspace/* /usr
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type d -print|sed 's@^@/usr/@'|xargs mkdir -p
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion copies all contents, including files, from /workspace to /usr, rather than just replicating the directory structure without the files. The expert's completion replicates only the directory structure using find, sed, and mkdir."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display a long listing of the oldest file under '/workspace' directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -printf '%T@ %p\n' | sort -n | head -1
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -printf '%T+ %p\n' | sort | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2}' | xargs ls -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not display a long listing of the oldest file. It finds and sorts files by modification time but does not format the output as a long listing. The expert solution correctly identifies the oldest file and uses 'ls -l' to display it in long format."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find the largest 2 directories under /workspace directory
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type d -exec du -sh {} \; | sort -rn | head -2
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type d -print0 | xargs -0 du | sort -n | tail -2 | cut -f2 | xargs -I{} du -sh {}
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-exec du -sh {}` which incorrectly calculates size including subdirectories, while the expert's completion correctly calculates the size excluding subdirectories by using `xargs` with `du` and handles spaces with `-print0` and `-0` options. This affects the accuracy of determining the largest directories."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all files with their paths that have identical content in /workspace directory
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec md5sum {} \; | sort | uniq -d
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f | xargs md5sum | sort | uniq -Dw32
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `uniq -d`, which only shows duplicate lines after sorting by checksum. However, it doesn't include file paths in the output, thus not fully meeting the requirement to list files 'with their paths'. \n\nThe expert's completion uses `uniq -Dw32`, which preserves hash and filename side-by-side, identifying duplicates correctly and retaining file paths for the files with identical content."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Make directories for each unique file path in "/workspace/files.txt"
LLM's completion: find /workspace/files.txt | sort | uniq | xargs mkdir -p
Expert's completion: cat /workspace/files.txt |xargs -I {} dirname "{}"| sort -u | xargs -I{} mkdir -p "{}"
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to use 'find' on '/workspace/files.txt', which is incorrect because '/workspace/files.txt' is a file with paths, not a directory or set of directories to search through. The expert's completion correctly reads the file, extracts directory names, ensures uniqueness, and creates the directories."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the total disk usage in bytes of all files listed in "/workspace/files.txt"
LLM's completion: du -b /workspace/files.txt | awk '{print $1}' | paste -sd+ | bc
Expert's completion: cat /workspace/files.txt | xargs du -b | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion calculates the disk usage of the '/workspace/files.txt' file itself, not the files listed within it. The expert's completion correctly uses 'xargs' to calculate the disk usage of all files listed in the '/workspace/files.txt'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Unhide all hidden files in the /workspace directory. Do not include subdirectories.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -name ".*" -exec rm -i {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '.*' -exec sh -c 'mv "$0" "${0%/\.*}/${0##*/.}"' {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion incorrectly deletes hidden files using `rm -i`, which is not unhiding them. It also does not restrict the operation to the `/workspace` directory only, missing the `-maxdepth 1` option."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of differing lines in "/workspace/dir1/long.txt" and "/workspace/dir1/terminate.txt"
LLM's completion: diff -u /workspace/dir1/long.txt /workspace/dir1/terminate.txt | grep -c '^'
Expert's completion: diff /workspace/dir1/long.txt /workspace/dir1/terminate.txt | grep ^[\>\<] | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion counts all lines output by `diff`, including non-changed lines. The expert's solution counts only the differing lines by filtering lines starting with '>' or '<', which represent changes in the two files. Therefore, the LLM's solution is not faithful to the task described."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of differing lines in "/workspace/dir1/terminate.txt" and "/workspace/dir1/long.txt" with 0 lines of unified context
LLM's completion: diff -u0 /workspace/dir1/terminate.txt /workspace/dir1/long.txt | wc -l
Expert's completion: diff -U 0 /workspace/dir1/terminate.txt /workspace/dir1/long.txt | grep -v ^@ | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the '-u0' option which specifies zero lines of context in the unified diff format. However, it will count all lines in the diff output, including headers and line numbers introduced by the diff command. This does not strictly count the differing lines only.\n\nThe expert's completion uses '-U 0' and pipes the output to 'grep -v ^@' to exclude the unified diff headers (which start with '@'), ensuring only the differing lines are counted by 'wc -l'. Therefore, the LLM's translation is not entirely faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a symbolic link in directory "~/newlinks" for each file listed in "/workspace/results.txt"
LLM's completion: ln -s /workspace/results.txt ~/newlinks
Expert's completion: cat /workspace/results.txt | xargs -I{} ln -s {} ~/newlinks
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion creates a single symbolic link for the file '/workspace/results.txt' itself, rather than creating links for each file listed within that file. The expert's completion correctly reads each file path in '/workspace/results.txt' and creates symbolic links in '~/newlinks'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Delete all hidden files under /workspace
LLM's completion: find /workspace -name ".*" -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -name '.*' -delete
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion accurately finds and deletes hidden files, as it searches for file names beginning with a dot ('.'). It uses `-exec rm {}` which effectively deletes the files, similar to the expert's `-delete` option. Both completions accomplish the task of removing hidden files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display a dump of "/workspace/dir1/long.txt" as floating point values of double size
LLM's completion: h2py -f /workspace/dir1/long.txt -o float64
Expert's completion: od -t fD /workspace/dir1/long.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM used the command `h2py` which is not a standard Unix utility and incorrectly uses an option `-o float64`. The natural language description asks to display the file as double-sized floating point values, which `od -t fD` correctly interprets as 'f' for floating and 'D' for double precision. Therefore, the LLM's translation is not faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display differences between list of files in /workspace/dir1 and /workspace/dir2.
LLM's completion: diff -Naur /workspace/dir1 /workspace/dir2
Expert's completion: diff <(ls /workspace/dir1) <(ls /workspace/dir2)
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion compares the contents of the files in the directories, while the expert's completion compares the lists of filenames within the directories. The tasks are different: one compares file contents, the other compares file listings."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the file size of file '/workspace/dir1/sum.c' in bytes
LLM's completion: ls -l /workspace/dir1/sum.c | awk '{print $5}'
Expert's completion: du -sb /workspace/dir1/sum.c | cut -f1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `ls -l` which provides human-readable text and extracts the fifth field using `awk`, which is typically the size of a file in bytes based on `ls -l` output, but it's not a direct, reliable method for scripts. The expert's completion `du -sb` directly and reliably gets the file size in bytes. Thus, the LLM's completion is less faithful as it relies on the output format of `ls`."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the sizes and filepaths of all files/directories in /workspace directory sorted in descending order of size
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec du -h {} \; | sort -rh
Expert's completion: du /workspace -a -h | sort -hr
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion only finds files and not directories due to the use of `-type f`. It also uses `find` with `-exec du -h {}` which results in listing only files, not directories, thus differing from the intended comprehensive listing. The expert's completion correctly uses `du /workspace -a -h` to include both files and directories, sorted by size."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print percentage of the space used on the /workspace directory.
LLM's completion: du -sh /workspace | awk '{print $2/1024*100}'
Expert's completion: df -k /workspace | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion calculates disk usage in a human-readable format but does not convert it into a percentage of space used. It also divides by 1024, which is not appropriate for calculating a percentage. Meanwhile, the expert's completion uses `df -k` to obtain the disk usage percentage directly and accurately for the /workspace directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the contents of "/workspace/dir1/long.txt" in reverse order
LLM's completion: cat /workspace/dir1/long.txt | tac
Expert's completion: nl /workspace/dir1/long.txt | sort -nr | cut -b8-
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful. It uses `tac` to reverse the order of the lines in the file, which directly achieves the goal of printing the contents of the file in reverse order. This is a straightforward and efficient solution.\n\nThe expert's completion, on the other hand, adds line numbers and then sorts them in reverse order, subsequently removing the added line numbers. While it achieves the same result, the LLM's solution is more direct and simpler."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create an empty file "Icon" in workspace/ with a carriage return character in the end of its name.
LLM's completion: touch workspace/Icon\r
Expert's completion: echo $'workspace/Icon\r' | xargs touch
is_faithful=True explanation='Both translations achieve the intended purpose: creating an empty file named "Icon" with a carriage return character at the end in the specified directory. The LLM\'s use of `touch workspace/Icon\\r` directly creates the file, while the expert\'s approach uses echo and xargs for more explicit handling of the carriage return. Both are effective and faithful to the task.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a symbolc link in the /workspace/dir1 to root folder
LLM's completion: ln -s /root /workspace/dir1
Expert's completion: ln /workspace/dir1 -s /
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the expert's and the LLM's command aim to create a symbolic link pointing to the root directory. The LLM's command explicitly specifies the source and target, aligning with the typical `ln -s <target> <link_name>` syntax. The expert's command seems to reverse the usual order of source and target. Despite this, the LLM's version is faithful to the task by creating a symlink from `/workspace/dir1` to `/root` (interpreted as the root directory)."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display permissions, user, group, and full path for each file in the /workspace directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec ls -l {} \;
Expert's completion: tree /workspace -p -u -g -f
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` with `ls -l` to display permissions, user, and group for files in the directory tree, but it doesn't display the full path explicitly unless the working directory changes. The expert's completion uses `tree` with options `-p`, `-u`, `-g`, and `-f`, which directly matches the requirements by displaying permissions, user, group, and full path for each file. Therefore, the LLM's command isn't fully faithful to the specified task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for 'hello' case insensitively in all files under /workspace directory tree and show the matched lines with their filenames
LLM's completion: grep -i "hello" /workspace/*
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -print0  | xargs -0 grep -iH "hello"
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion `grep -i "hello" /workspace/*` only searches the files directly in the `/workspace` directory and does not search recursively through all subdirectories. The expert\'s completion uses `find` and `xargs` to ensure all files in the directory tree are searched, which fulfills the requirement to search in \'all files under /workspace directory tree.\''
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Unpack all *.gz archives in the /workspace directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -name '*.gz' | xargs -n1 gzip -dc
Expert's completion: find /workspace -name '*.gz' -print0 | xargs -0 gunzip
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `gzip -dc`, which decompresses a .gz file and outputs the content to stdout. This does not unpack the files as specified. The expert's completion uses `gunzip`, which correctly unpacks the .gz files in place. Additionally, the expert's use of `-print0` and `xargs -0` ensures filenames with spaces are handled correctly, which the LLM's version does not address."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Uncompress "/workspace/archive.tar.gz" and extract the archive to "/backup"
LLM's completion: tar -xvf /workspace/archive.tar.gz -C /backup
Expert's completion: gzip -dc /workspace/archive.tar.gz | tar -xf - -C /backup
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `tar -xvf` with the `-C` option, which correctly uncompresses and extracts the tar.gz file to the specified directory `/backup`. This matches the intent of the task, which is to uncompress and extract the archive to the target directory. The expert's version explicitly uses `gzip -dc` to handle decompression, but `tar -xvf` can handle the compressed archive as well, making the LLM's completion faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a symbolic link to "/workspace/dir1/terminate.txt" named "/workspace/test"
LLM's completion: ln -s "/workspace/dir1/terminate.txt" "/workspace/test"
Expert's completion: ln /workspace/dir1/terminate.txt /workspace/test
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `-s` flag in the `ln` command, which creates a symbolic link as required. The expert's completion, however, misses the `-s` flag, thus creating a hard link instead. Therefore, the LLM's completion is faithful to the task by correctly using a symbolic link."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Retrieve only build number of current kernel, ie. #104
LLM's completion: cat /proc/version | grep -oEi "(Linux|kernel) version\s+\d+\.\d+\.\d+\s+\d+" | sed's/.*\s+\d+\.\d+\.\d+\s+\(.\+\).*/\1/'
Expert's completion: uname -v | grep -o '#[0-9]\+'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful. It attempts to extract information from `/proc/version`, but this does not specifically isolate the build number of the current kernel version. The expert's solution correctly extracts just the build number using `uname -v` and a grep pattern to capture 'build numbers' in the format #104."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print reverse lookup for adress 127.0.0.1
LLM's completion: host 127.0.0.1 | rev | cut -d''-f1 | rev
Expert's completion: dig -x 127.0.0.1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion combines commands inappropriately. It uses `host` with unnecessary piping and processing, which doesn't directly reflect a reverse lookup request. Conversely, the expert's completion using `dig -x 127.0.0.1` is a standard method for performing a reverse DNS lookup."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List file information of the full path of command "grep"
LLM's completion: ls $(which grep)
Expert's completion: ls -ald `which grep`
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `ls $(which grep)`, which provides basic information about the 'grep' executable. The expert's completion, `ls -ald \\\\`which grep\\\\``, uses `-a` to show all files including hidden ones, `-l` for a detailed listing, and `-d` to show information about the directory entry itself if it is a directory, not its contents. This provides more detailed information as per the task's requirements."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Extract host name part from "http://www.google.com"
LLM's completion: echo "http://www.google.com" | sed -e's/.*\///'
Expert's completion: echo "http://www.google.com" | cut -d'/' -f3
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `sed` with `-e's/.*\\///'`, which extracts the part after the last `/`. However, to extract the host name, we need to isolate the string between the second and third `/`. The expert's solution correctly uses `cut -d'/' -f3` to extract the host name, making the LLM's solution unfaithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List environment variables and their values, escaping all semicolons with a backslash.
LLM's completion: env | sed's/;/\\;/g'
Expert's completion: env | sed 's/;/\\;/g'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is missing a space between 'sed' and the replacement pattern, making it syntactically incorrect."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Displays a tree of all process alongside their command line arguments.
LLM's completion: pmap --tree
Expert's completion: pstree -a
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'pmap --tree', which is incorrect as 'pmap' is used for memory mapping, not listing processes in a tree structure. The expert's completion 'pstree -a' correctly uses 'pstree' with the '-a' flag to display processes alongside their command line arguments."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print numbers 1 through 10 separated by ":"
LLM's completion: seq 1 10 | tr'' ':'
Expert's completion: yes | head -n10 | grep -n . | cut -d: -f1 | paste -sd:
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful because it has syntax errors (`tr'' ':'`), and it misuses the `seq` command without a proper pipe or separator to achieve the intended output. Moreover, it also lacks the correct implementation to separate numbers by `:`. The expert's version correctly uses a series of commands to number lines (`grep -n`), cut the correct field, and join them with `paste -sd:`, which accurately reflects the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print all readline bindings
LLM's completion: rlprint-bindings
Expert's completion: bind -P
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `rlprint-bindings` is not a valid Bash command and does not fulfill the task of printing readline bindings. The expert's completion `bind -P` is the correct Bash command to list all readline key bindings."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list names of bind functions containing "p"
LLM's completion: nm --defined-only --extern --with-libs --line-numbers path/to/file | grep 'p'
Expert's completion: bind -l | grep p
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `nm` command, which is for listing symbols in object files and doesn't relate to listing bind functions. The expert's completion correctly uses the `bind -l` command, which lists all bound functions, and pipes it to `grep` to filter for those containing 'p'. The LLM's solution is not faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Save first IP address of domain 'google.com' in 'address' variable and display it
LLM's completion: address=$(dig google.com +short | head -n 1); echo $address
Expert's completion: address=$(dig +short google.com | grep -E '^[0-9.]+$' | head -n 1) && echo $address
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and expert's completions correctly use the `dig` command to find the IP address for 'google.com'. The LLM's version directly uses `head -n 1` to get the first result, which is simpler and works well for this common case. The expert's version adds a `grep` command to ensure the result is a valid IP address, which adds robustness. However, the LLM's completion is still faithful to the task as specified in the description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all characters except ";" and digits from the string "  Hello world;876	  "
LLM's completion: echo "  Hello world;876	  " | sed's/[^;0-9]//g'
Expert's completion: echo '  Hello world;876	  ' | tr -cd ';0-9'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion has a syntax error in the sed command due to a missing space between 'sed' and the start of the pattern. Additionally, using 'sed' in this context is less straightforward than using 'tr' for character deletion. The expert uses 'tr -cd', which is the correct method to remove all characters except ';' and digits."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove leading and trailing spaces or tabs from "  Hello world!	  "
LLM's completion: echo "  Hello world!	  " | sed's/^[[:space:]]*//;s/[[:space:]]*$//;'
Expert's completion: echo '  Hello world!	  ' | sed -e 's/^[ \t]*//' | sed -e 's/[ \t]*$//'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is missing spaces after 'sed' and before the opening single quotes in the 'sed' command. It also incorrectly uses '[[:space:]]' which works, but the format seems off due to missing spaces. The expert's version is more standard and better formatted."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove the last 3 characters from "987654321"
LLM's completion: echo "987654321" | sed's/.$//3'
Expert's completion: echo 987654321 | rev | cut -c 4- | rev
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's solution attempts to use `sed` with an incorrect syntax `sed's/.$//3'`. The command intended to remove the last three characters is not valid as it stands, and `sed` doesn't directly support counting from the end in this manner.\n\nThe expert solution reverses the string, removes the first three characters, and then reverses it back, which effectively removes the last three characters. It is a valid approach. \n\nTherefore, the LLM's completion does not correctly address the task of removing the last three characters from the input."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print source of the file system containing current working directory.
LLM's completion: fsck --source
Expert's completion: df . | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `fsck --source`, which does not exist in standard bash and is unrelated to printing the source of the file system. The expert's completion correctly uses the `df` command to find the source by inspecting the file system details of the current directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all variables (names only) with names containing "H".
LLM's completion: declare -p H*
Expert's completion: env | awk -F= '{if($1 ~ /H/) print $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion, `declare -p H*`, lists variables starting with 'H' rather than all variables containing 'H' in their names. The expert's completion, `env | awk -F= '{if($1 ~ /H/) print $1}'`, correctly finds any variable that includes 'H' anywhere in its name."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print a list of unique users who are logged in
LLM's completion: who | sort -u | awk '{print $1}'
Expert's completion: who | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort | uniq
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's command uses `sort -u` with `awk`, which assumes the output of `who` is already sorted uniquely and that the user names are the first space-delimited field. However, it may not accurately handle situations where fields are not properly delimited, leading to potentially incorrect outputs. The expert's version specifically extracts the first field as usernames using `cut`, then sorts and uniquely filters them with `sort` and `uniq`. This ensures more consistent results."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: ping 192.168.1.1
LLM's completion: ping -c 3 192.168.1.1
Expert's completion: ping -w 1 192.168.1.1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion adds the '-c 3' option, which specifies the number of ping requests to send, defaulting to 3. The task was simply to 'ping 192.168.1.1', without extra specifications on the count of requests. The expert's version, 'ping -w 1 192.168.1.1', uses the '-w 1' option to set a timeout, ensuring only essential modifications were made."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print a line of 99 '=' characters
LLM's completion: echo $(printf "%99s" | tr'' '=')
Expert's completion: seq -s= 100|tr -d '[:digit:]'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion has a syntax error with the 'tr'' command as there should be a space between 'tr' and the first argument ''. The use of 'tr' without a space makes the command incorrect. The concept involves creating a string of '=' characters, but the syntax is incorrect for the task.\n\nThe Expert's completion uses 'seq' to generate numbers and replaces them with '=', which correctly results in 99 '=' characters."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Displays calendar of a previous, current and next month for December of 2120 year.
LLM's completion: cal 2120 12
Expert's completion: cal -3 12 2120
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion only displays the calendar for December 2120, not the previous and next months. The expert's completion correctly uses the `-3` option to display three months (previous, current, next) for December 2120."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Extract, sort and print only group names from /etc/group.
LLM's completion: cut -d: -f2 /etc/group | sort | uniq
Expert's completion: cut -d: -f1 /etc/group | sort
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion extracts the second field from each line, which is not the group name. In the `/etc/group` file, the group name is in the first field. The expert's completion correctly extracts the first field using `cut -d: -f1`. Additionally, the LLM's use of `uniq` is unnecessary after `sort`, as `sort` will naturally handle duplicate entries."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 10
LLM's completion: awk 'BEGIN {s=0; for (i=1; i<=10; i++) s=s+i} END {print s}'
Expert's completion: seq 10 | jq -s 'add'
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions correctly calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10. The LLM's solution uses 'awk' with a loop to sum the numbers, while the expert's solution uses 'seq' to generate the sequence and 'jq' to sum them. Both methods are valid and accomplish the same task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of files and directories in the entire testbed directory
LLM's completion: find testbed -type f -o -type d | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-type f` and `-type d` with the `-o` (or) operator to count either files or directories, but should not use this method as the `find` command by default includes both. The expert's answer correctly just uses `find /testbed | wc -l` to count everything in the testbed directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the number of python files in the testbed directory.
LLM's completion: find testbed -name '*.py' | wc -l
Expert's completion: find testbed -type f -name "*.py" | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s translation is mostly faithful to the task. The command `find testbed -name \'*.py\' | wc -l` will print the number of entries ending with ".py" in the testbed directory and its subdirectories. However, it doesn\'t explicitly restrict to files only and might include directories if any have names ending with ".py". The expert\'s solution explicitly uses `-type f` to ensure only files are counted, which is a more precise match to the task description. Despite this nuance, the LLM\'s version will often work correctly, assuming typical directory contents.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Sort the lines of textfile1.txt in reverse alphabetical order and save the result to a new file
LLM's completion: sort -r textfile1.txt > newfile.txt
Expert's completion: sort -r /testbed/dir1/textfile1.txt > /testbed/dir1/textfile1_reverse_sorted.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses `sort -r` to sort the lines in reverse order and redirects the output to a new file. The paths differ, but this is not specified in the task description, so the LLM's version is faithful to the core task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for all files containing the word 'Shell' in testbed.
LLM's completion: find testbed -type f -exec grep -i 'Shell' {} \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec grep -l 'Shell' {} +
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's command is not completely faithful because it uses `-i` with `grep`, making the search case-insensitive, whereas the expert's translation does not include this option. Also, the LLM's command uses `;` which executes `grep` on each file individually, while the expert's command uses `+`, which is more efficient as it groups files together. The `-l` option in the expert's command ensures that only filenames are printed, which is more in line with typical use when searching files with certain content."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find all symbolic links in the testbed directory.
LLM's completion: find testbed -type l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type l
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions use the `find` command to search for symbolic links (`-type l`) in the `testbed` directory. The only difference is the absence of a leading slash in the LLM's version, but it does not affect functionality if `testbed` is understood as a path relative to the current directory. Therefore, the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Get the total size of all files in testbed/ and save it to total_size.txt
LLM's completion: find testbed/ -type f -exec du -c {} \; | awk '{print $1}' > total_size.txt
Expert's completion: du -sh testbed/ | awk '{print $1}' > total_size.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful to the task. It uses `find` to locate individual files and calculates their sizes separately, which may not consider directory sizes accurately. The expert's solution uses `du -sh` to obtain the total size of the directory correctly."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all files in the directory /testbed/dir1 and sort them by size in human-readable format
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir1 -type f | xargs ls -lh | sort -h -n
Expert's completion: ls -lhS /testbed/dir1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` and `xargs` to list files, which adds unnecessary complexity and does not ensure they are sorted by size in each step. The sorting part `sort -h -n` is also extraneous due to the unnecessary piped operations that don't align optimally with sorting by size in `ls` directly. The expert's completion uses `ls -lhS`, which directly lists and sorts files by size in one command."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of lines in files under the directory /testbed/dir2.
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir2 -type f -exec wc -l {} \;
Expert's completion: grep -rl . /testbed/dir2 | xargs wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `find` command to locate files under `/testbed/dir2` and then executes `wc -l` on each file to count lines. This performs the intended task correctly.\n\nThe expert's completion lists files under `/testbed/dir2` with `grep` and then uses `xargs wc -l` to count lines in those files. Both approaches achieve the same result.\n\nTherefore, the LLM's translation faithfully executes the task of counting lines in files under the specified directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the name and size of the 3 largest files in the directory /testbed/dir3
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir3 -type f -printf "%s %p\n" | sort -nr | head -n 3
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir3 -type f -exec ls -lhS {} + | sort -rh -k5 | head -n 3
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'find' to print the file size and path, sorting them directly by size. However, it lacks the 'ls -lh' part needed to print human-readable sizes and the 'sort -k5' option used by the expert to properly sort by size. Thus, while it attempts to solve the problem, it doesn't fully match the requirement to print the name and size in the same format as the expert solution."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find all files modified in the last 2 hours and compress them into a tarball named archive.tar.gz in the directory /testbed
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -mtime -2 -exec tar -czf archive.tar.gz {} \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -mmin -120 -print0 | xargs -0 tar -czf /testbed/archive.tar.gz
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-mtime -2`, which finds files modified in the last 2 days, not 2 hours. The expert's completion uses `-mmin -120`, which correctly specifies files modified in the last 120 minutes (2 hours). Additionally, the LLM's use of `{}` in the `-exec` option does not accumulate files correctly into a single tarball, while the expert's use of `xargs` ensures all found files are compressed into one tarball."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all subdirectories of /testbed that are not named subdir1
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type d -not -name subdir1
Expert's completion: ls -d /testbed/*/ | grep -v /subdir1/
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the 'find' command to locate directories under '/testbed' and excludes any directory named 'subdir1'. This method effectively lists all subdirectories excluding 'subdir1', which aligns with the task described."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for all files that contain the string 'text file' under the directory /testbed
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec grep -l "text file" {} \;
Expert's completion: grep -r 'text file' /testbed
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and expert's completions correctly achieve the goal of finding files containing 'text file'.\n\n- **LLM's Completion:** The command uses `find` to locate files and `grep -l` to print the names of files containing the string. This accurately fulfills the task.\n\n- **Expert's Completion:** This uses `grep -r` to recursively search through files in the directory. This also accurately fulfills the task.\n\nDespite the different approaches, both methods are valid and produce the desired outcome."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Compute the MD5 hash of all files under the directory /testbed and store them in a file named hashes.txt in the same directory
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f | xargs md5sum > /testbed/hashes.txt
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec md5sum {} + > /testbed/hashes.txt
is_faithful=True explanation='Both solutions effectively find all files in the /testbed directory, compute their MD5 hashes, and redirect the output to the file hashes.txt. The LLM uses xargs, while the expert uses the -exec option of find. Both approaches are valid and achieve the same result.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the line number and contents of all lines containing the string 'value3' in the file /testbed/dir1/subdir1/jsonfile1.json
LLM's completion: grep -Hn 'value3' /testbed/dir1/subdir1/jsonfile1.json
Expert's completion: grep -n 'value3' /testbed/dir1/subdir1/jsonfile1.json
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the Expert's completions use the `grep` command with the `-n` option to print line numbers and line contents containing 'value3'. The LLM's completion uses `-Hn` to explicitly include the filename in the output, which still fulfills the requirement but adds additional information. Both completions achieve the task as described in the natural language prompt."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for all the files in /testbed directory and its subdirectories that contain the word 'Hello' and replace it with 'Hi' in-place.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*" | xargs sed -i's/Hello/Hi/g'
Expert's completion: grep -rl "Hello" /testbed | xargs sed -i 's/Hello/Hi/g'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` to search all files, but it doesn't filter for files containing 'Hello'. The expert's solution uses `grep -rl 'Hello' /testbed` to specifically target files containing 'Hello' before using `sed` to replace it with 'Hi'. This ensures only relevant files are processed."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the contents of textfile3.txt and textfile4.txt side by side, with line numbers and a separator between them.
LLM's completion: cat -n textfile3.txt | cat -n textfile4.txt | cat -s
Expert's completion: paste <(nl /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt) <(nl /testbed/dir1/subdir1/textfile4.txt)
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `cat -n` to number lines and `cat -s` which removes extra empty lines, but it doesn't display the files side by side or ensure a separator between them. The expert's completion uses `paste` to display the files side by side after numbering them with `nl`, which is faithful to the task description."
