Natural Language Description: list all files in the current directory including hidden files
LLM's completion: ls -la
Expert's completion: ls -a
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions include hidden files in the listing. The LLM's use of `ls -la` not only lists hidden files but also includes additional details like file permissions, sizes, etc. However, it still fulfills the primary requirement of listing all files, including hidden ones."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: create a directory /testbed/test_dir
LLM's completion: mkdir -p /testbed/test_dir
Expert's completion: mkdir /testbed/test_dir
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion is faithful. Both completions will achieve the task of creating the directory "/testbed/test_dir". The LLM\'s use of the `-p` option ensures that missing parent directories are also created and avoids errors if the directory already exists, making it a more robust solution.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: remove a file named does_not_exist.txt
LLM's completion: rm -f does_not_exist.txt
Expert's completion: rm does_not_exist.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `-f` flag, which forces the removal and suppresses error messages if the file does not exist. Although slightly different, it achieves the same task as `rm` since the intent is to remove the file without concern for errors about its existence. The use of `-f` makes it robust but retains the task's integrity."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print hello world
LLM's completion: echo "hello world"
Expert's completion: echo hello world
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses the `echo` command to print 'hello world', and the inclusion of quotes does not alter the output, making it faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the path of the bash executable
LLM's completion: echo $BASH
Expert's completion: which bash
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `echo $BASH` prints the current shell's name, not the path of the bash executable. The expert's completion `which bash` correctly prints the path to the bash executable."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system utilization stats
LLM's completion: top
Expert's completion: vmstat
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `top`, which provides a dynamic, real-time view of running systems, showing processes and usage statistics. However, it is not the most direct tool for printing simple utilization stats. The expert's use of `vmstat` is more explicit in showing system utilization statistics like memory, swap, and CPU usage in a concise format. Therefore, while `top` gives more information, it does not faithfully fulfill the request as directly as `vmstat`."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system load averages
LLM's completion: uptime -p
Expert's completion: w
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `uptime -p` shows the system uptime in a pretty format, not the load averages. The expert's completion `w` displays logged-in users and system load averages, making it a more faithful translation."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system memory usage
LLM's completion: free -m
Expert's completion: free
is_faithful=True explanation="The command `free -m` is a faithful completion as it prints the system memory usage in megabytes, providing a specific detail not mentioned in the natural language description but still performs the required task. The expert's completion `free` also achieves the task by printing memory usage in the default format. Both completions correctly fulfill the requirement of printing the system memory usage."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system disk usage
LLM's completion: du -sh /
Expert's completion: df
is_faithful=False explanation="The expert uses the `df` command, which shows disk space usage statistics for the file system. The LLM's completion with `du -sh /` displays the disk usage of the root directory, not the overall system disk usage. The `df` command is more appropriate for the given task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system IP address
LLM's completion: ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk -F"src " 'NR==1 {print $2}'
Expert's completion: hostname -I
is_faithful=True explanation='Both the LLM\'s and the expert\'s completions aim to extract the system\'s IP address, albeit using different methods.\n\n- The LLM\'s solution `ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk -F"src " \'NR==1 {print $2}\'` attempts to fetch the IP address by utilizing the routing information to Google\'s DNS (8.8.8.8). This approach usually returns the primary IP address used for external communication.\n\n- The Expert\'s solution `hostname -I` directly prints out all the IP addresses of the machine that are usable in network interfaces, often including the local subnet.\n\nBoth are commonly used commands to find a system\'s IP address, and while they may present different results in complex network settings, the LLM\'s completion is generally faithful to the task of printing the system IP address.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the ip addresses of the system DNS servers
LLM's completion: nmcli dev show | grep DNS | awk '{print $2}'
Expert's completion: cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `nmcli dev show | grep DNS | awk '{print $2}'`, which might not accurately target the DNS servers' IPs, as 'nmcli' outputs a variety of connection details not specifically limited to DNS servers. The expert's approach `cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver` is more direct, as it reads from '/etc/resolv.conf' where DNS servers are typically listed under 'nameserver' entries. The LLM's command may not reliably output the same or correct information based on different network configurations."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the network interfaces
LLM's completion: nmcli d
Expert's completion: ifconfig
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion "nmcli d" and the expert\'s completion "ifconfig" both display network interfaces, although using different tools. "ifconfig" is a classic command for displaying network interface information, while "nmcli d" uses NetworkManager\'s command-line interface to list devices, including network interfaces. Both approaches are valid and faithfully execute the task of displaying network interfaces.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the routing table
LLM's completion: ip route show
Expert's completion: route
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion `ip route show` and the expert's completion `route` both display the routing table. They use different commands, but both achieve the same result. The LLM's version is more modern and specific, using the `ip` tool, which is considered better practice in newer systems."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the last logged in users and show the full user and domain names
LLM's completion: last -d
Expert's completion: last -w
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `-d` flag, which may cause `last` to attempt a DNS lookup, but it doesn't achieve the task of showing the full user and domain names. The expert's completion uses the `-w` flag, which explicitly shows the full login name, achieving the task of displaying both user and domain names."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: base64 encode the string 'hello'
LLM's completion: echo "hello" | base64
Expert's completion: echo 'hello' | base64
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion is faithful to the task. It uses `echo "hello" | base64` to encode the string \'hello\' in base64 format, which is functionally equivalent to the expert\'s completion of `echo \'hello\' | base64`. Both commands will produce the same output.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: base64 decode the string 'aGVsbG8='
LLM's completion: echo 'aGVsbG8=' | base64 --decode
Expert's completion: echo 'aGVsbG8=' | base64 -d
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is correct. The `--decode` flag in `base64` is functionally equivalent to the `-d` flag used by the expert. Both commands will correctly decode the base64-encoded string."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print lines containing 'console' in the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: cat setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | grep console
Expert's completion: grep 'console' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `cat` to pass the contents of the file to `grep`, while the expert's completion uses `grep` directly on the file. Both approaches will yield the same result, printing lines that contain 'console'. The use of `cat` is unnecessary but does not affect the functionality."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the current process priority
LLM's completion: renice -p $$
Expert's completion: nice
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `renice -p $$` is used to change the priority of a process but not to display it. The expert's completion `nice` is used to display the current process priority."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list memory information
LLM's completion: dmidecode --type memory
Expert's completion: lsmem
is_faithful=True explanation="Both `dmidecode --type memory` and `lsmem` can be used to list memory information, although they provide different levels and types of detail. The LLM's choice is faithful to the task description since it retrieves memory details."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the bash profile in the home directory
LLM's completion: cat ~/.bash_profile
Expert's completion: cat ~/.bashrc
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion 'cat ~/.bash_profile' is faithful to the task of printing the 'bash profile' in the home directory. The expert's completion 'cat ~/.bashrc' refers to a different file, as `.bashrc` is commonly used for command line specific programs, whereas `.bash_profile` is executed for login shells. The natural language specifically asks for the 'bash profile', which matches '.bash_profile', not '.bashrc'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: create a symbolic link to /testbed/hello.php named /testbed/link
LLM's completion: sudo ln -s /testbed/hello.php /testbed/link
Expert's completion: ln -s /testbed/hello.php /testbed/link
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. It creates a symbolic link named /testbed/link pointing to /testbed/hello.php. The use of 'sudo' adds superuser privileges, which may not be necessary unless the user lacks the permission to create the link, but it does not alter the faithfulness of the command."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: change the ownership of /testbed/test.txt to user 'nobody'
LLM's completion: sudo chown nobody /testbed/test.txt
Expert's completion: chown nobody /testbed/test.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. It includes the `sudo` command, which is often used to obtain the necessary permissions to change file ownership, especially on systems that may restrict such changes to administrative users. However, the essence of changing the ownership to 'nobody' for the specified file path is correctly captured in both completions."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: change permissions of /testbed/test.txt to read-only for everyone
LLM's completion: chmod a-w /testbed/test.txt
Expert's completion: chmod 444 /testbed/test.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `chmod a-w`, which removes write permissions but doesn't explicitly set the file to read-only for everyone. The expert's completion `chmod 444` changes permissions to read-only for all (owner, group, others)."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: count the lines, words, and characters in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: wc -lwc /mnt/c/Projects/Github/nl2bash/setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: wc setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the incorrect `-lwc` option, which isn't valid for the `wc` command. The command `wc` by itself, as provided in the expert's completion, already counts lines, words, and characters, so it doesn't need any specific options for this task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the lines in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh sorted alphabetically
LLM's completion: sort -k1,1 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: sort setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'sort -k1,1', which sorts by the first key. This could produce the correct result if the lines are simple and sorting by the first column is sufficient. However, for general alphabetical sorting of entire lines, just 'sort' is more appropriate. The expert's completion uses 'sort' without specifying keys, which is the standard way to sort lines alphabetically in their entirety. Thus, the LLM's completion is not fully faithful to the task as described."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the unique lines in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: sort -u setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: uniq setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The expert's response uses `uniq`, which directly prints unique lines but requires sorted input to work correctly. However, the LLM's method `sort -u` sorts the file and then eliminates duplicates, ensuring unique lines but also potentially changing the order of lines. The tasks have different behaviors if order matters, so they are not equivalent."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display network statistics
LLM's completion: ifconfig
Expert's completion: netstat --statistics
is_faithful=False explanation="The command 'ifconfig' is used to configure or display network interfaces, not to show detailed network statistics. The expert's completion 'netstat --statistics' provides a more comprehensive display of network statistics, such as packet transfer counts."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display network interfaces
LLM's completion: ip link show
Expert's completion: netstat -i
is_faithful=True explanation="Both `ip link show` and `netstat -i` can be used to display network interfaces. Although they present the information differently, LLM's completion is still faithful to the task of displaying network interfaces."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: show running daemons and services
LLM's completion: systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
Expert's completion: service --status-all
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running', which only lists running services managed by systemd, not all running daemons and services. The expert's completion, 'service --status-all', provides a broader list, including not just systemd but also potentially other init systems, showing the status of all services."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list all users on the system
LLM's completion: cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1
Expert's completion: getent passwd
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. Both the LLM's and expert's translations achieve the same outcome, which is to list all user names on the system. The LLM uses the `/etc/passwd` file directly, extracting the first field that contains the usernames, while the expert uses `getent passwd`, which is a more robust and system-level way to access this information. Nevertheless, both methods provide a list of users."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: extract the filename from this path '/usr/local/bin/my_script.sh'
LLM's completion: basename '/usr/local/bin/my_script.sh'
Expert's completion: basename /usr/local/bin/my_script.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses the `basename` command with the provided path to extract the filename 'my_script.sh'. The use of single quotes around the path is acceptable in bash to denote a string, thus the LLM's completion is faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: extract the directory from this path '/usr/local/bin/my_script.sh'
LLM's completion: dirname '/usr/local/bin/my_script.sh'
Expert's completion: dirname /usr/local/bin/my_script.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `dirname` command with the path enclosed in quotes, which is still correct and will yield the same result. The quotes ensure that the path is treated as a single argument, even if it contains spaces or special characters. Thus, it is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: send the message 'System maintenance in 10 minutes!' to all logged in users
LLM's completion: echo "System maintenance in 10 minutes!" | wall
Expert's completion: wall 'System maintenance in 10 minutes!'
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `echo` to send the message to the `wall` command, which is correct as it will broadcast the message to all logged-in users. Both methods achieve the same result, so the LLM's output is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the contents of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh with lines wrapped to 40 characters
LLM's completion: cat -w -s setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | fold -w 40
Expert's completion: fold -w 40 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `cat` with options `-w -s` which are not valid for `cat`. The correct option for wrapping is `fold -w 40`. The use of `cat` here is unnecessary and potentially incorrect due to the options used."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print all system configuration variables
LLM's completion: printenv
Expert's completion: getconf -a
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `printenv` is used to print environment variables, not system configuration variables. The expert's completion `getconf -a` is the correct command to print all system configuration variables."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the max cpu time
LLM's completion: btop --max-cpu
Expert's completion: ulimit -t
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion 'btop --max-cpu' is incorrect. The command 'btop' is not standard and doesn't directly print the max CPU time. The expert's completion 'ulimit -t' is the correct way to get the maximum CPU time a process can use."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: display the configured size of long integers
LLM's completion: gdb -q --batch --eval-command='show sizeof long'
Expert's completion: getconf LONG_BIT
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `gdb` to display the size of `long`, which gives the size of a long integer in bytes. The expert's completion uses `getconf LONG_BIT` to display the size of long integers in bits, which is more typical for system configurations. The approaches show different units, not directly comparable in output."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the number of times the word 'the' appears in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: grep -o '\bthe\b' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | wc -l
Expert's completion: grep -o 'the' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. It uses the regular expression `\\bthe\\b`, which ensures that 'the' is matched as a whole word, avoiding partial matches like 'there' or 'them'. This actually provides a more accurate count of the standalone word 'the'. The expert's solution might count 'the' within other words, which is less precise according to the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the number of files in the current directory
LLM's completion: find . -type f | wc -l
Expert's completion: ls -a | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. It accurately counts the number of files in the current directory, including those in subdirectories, while the expert's completion counts all entries, including hidden files and directories, without descending into subdirectories."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print first line of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: head -n 1 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: sed -n '1p' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's translations correctly output the first line of the specified file. While the expert uses `sed`, the LLM's use of `head -n 1` is also a valid and faithful approach to achieve the same result."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the last line of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: tail -n 1 setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: sed -n '$p' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM and the expert's translations achieve the same goal of printing the last line of the file. The LLM's use of `tail -n 1` straightforwardly prints the last line of the file, which aligns with the task description. The expert's use of `sed -n '$p'` also effectively prints the last line by targeting the last line marker `$`. Both approaches are correct and faithful to the described task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print lines 3 to 5 of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: cat -n setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | sed -n '3,5p'
Expert's completion: sed -n '3,5p' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `cat -n` which numbers the lines, but this isn't necessary for printing lines 3 to 5 and could alter the output format. The expert solution directly uses `sed` to print the required lines without modification."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print every other line of setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
LLM's completion: awk 'NR%2==0' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: sed -n '1~2p' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful. Both commands correctly print every other line based on the line number being even (for LLM) or odd (for Expert), effectively achieving the same result."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print lines in the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh that are less than 20 characters
LLM's completion: awk 'length($0) < 20' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: awk 'length < 40' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses `awk` to filter lines based on their length being less than 20 characters, which matches the natural language description. The expert's completion checks for lines less than 40 characters instead, indicating a discrepancy or error in the expert's translation, making the LLM's version faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print lines in the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh that contain the characters 'the' and 'a'
LLM's completion: grep "the.*a" setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh
Expert's completion: grep 'the' setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh | grep 'a'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion will only match lines where 'the' occurs before 'a' on the same line. It uses a regex pattern that requires 'the' followed by anything (.*) until 'a', which does not satisfy the requirement if 'a' appears somewhere else on the same line before 'the'. The expert's completion checks for the presence of both 'the' and 'a' anywhere on the line separately, ensuring all needed lines are captured."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: encrypt the file setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh using the aes-256-cbc algorithm with password 'password' and save it to out.enc
LLM's completion: openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh -out out.enc -pass pass:password
Expert's completion: openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh -pass pass:password -out out.enc
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM’s completion accurately uses the `openssl` command with the `enc` option and specifies the `aes-256-cbc` algorithm. It correctly takes `setup_nl2b_fs_1.sh` as the input file and saves the output to `out.enc`. The password is provided using `-pass pass:password`. The order of `-out` and `-pass` does not affect functionality, making the LLM’s completion faithful.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: create a file named 'world.txt' with the text 'hello' inside
LLM's completion: echo hello > world.txt
Expert's completion: echo 'hello' > world.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="Both completions create a file named 'world.txt' with the text 'hello' inside. The expert's completion includes single quotes around 'hello', which are not strictly necessary here, as the text does not contain spaces or special characters. The lack of single quotes in the LLM's completion does not affect the output, making it faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the system's public ip address
LLM's completion: curl -s http://checkip.amazonaws.com
Expert's completion: curl ipinfo.io/ip
is_faithful=True explanation='Both commands are valid methods to retrieve the public IP address of a system. The LLM\'s completion uses "http://checkip.amazonaws.com", which is a service that returns the public IP, and the expert\'s completion uses "ipinfo.io/ip", which provides similar functionality. Thus, the LLM\'s completion is faithful to the task.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate a list of duplicate md5 sum hashes for all the ".java" files in the /testbed directory
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.java" | xargs md5sum | sort | uniq -d
Expert's completion: md5sum /testbed/*.java | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -d
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to find and list duplicate md5 sums, but it omits a key step. `uniq -d` alone does not suffice because it checks for duplicates in consecutive lines. The expert's completion ensures only the hashes are processed and sorted, which is necessary before using `uniq -d` to detect duplicates. Therefore, the LLM's approach may not return accurate results without this filtering step."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of the md5 sum of all the files under /testbed/dir2/subdir2 sorted by filename
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir2/subdir2 -type f | sort | xargs md5sum | md5sum
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir2/subdir2 -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 md5sum | awk '{print $1}' | md5sum
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful because it fails to handle filenames with spaces or special characters correctly. The expert uses `-print0`, `sort -z`, and `xargs -0` to handle these cases, ensuring accuracy. The LLM's solution may give incorrect results if such filenames are present."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of the contents of the sorted list of files "$FILES"
LLM's completion: cat $(sort -u <<< "$FILES") | md5sum
Expert's completion: cat $(echo $FILES | tr ' ' '\n' | sort) | md5sum
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion uses `sort -u <<< "$FILES"` which sorts and removes duplicates in a single step. This does not account for the distinct sorting and formatting as the expert\'s completion, which uses `tr \' \' \'\\n\'` to convert spaces to new lines before sorting. The expert\'s completion keeps the original order of files without removing duplicates unless sorted.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of the sorted list of md5 sums of all ".py" files under /testbed/dir1/subdir1
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir1/subdir1 -name '*.py' | xargs md5sum | sort | md5sum
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir1/subdir1 -type f -name *.py -exec md5sum {} + | awk '{print $1}' | sort | md5sum
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not strip filenames from intermediate md5 outputs, potentially altering the order and thus affecting the final md5 sum. The expert uses `awk '{print $1}'` to isolate the md5 values before sorting, ensuring accurate and faithful calculation."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the total disk usage for each ".txt" file on the /testbed directory and prepend the system host name to the output
LLM's completion: du -sh /testbed/*.txt | awk '{print "'$(hostname)'", $0}'
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.txt" -exec du {} + | awk -v hostname="$(hostname)" '{print hostname, $0}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `du -sh`, which summarizes disk usage for all .txt files collectively, not individually. It also doesn't recursively search for files like the expert's use of `find` does."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Change permissions for all PHP files under the /testbed directory tree to 755 and print the number of files changed
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -name '*.php' | xargs chmod 755 | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" -exec chmod 755 {} \; -exec /bin/echo {} \; | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `xargs` for changing the permissions, which is generally not an issue. However, it counts the lines output by `wc -l`, which does not accurately capture the number of files changed because `chmod` does not produce output that `wc` can count. The expert's completion, on the other hand, counts the files by using `-exec /bin/echo {} \\;` to print each filename, which `wc -l` then accurately counts."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Check if the current shell is running within a 'screen' process and print "True" or "False"
LLM's completion: echo $([[ $(ps -p $$ -o ppid=) =~ $(pgrep screen) ]] && echo True || echo False)
Expert's completion: pstree -s $$ | grep -q "screen" && echo "True" || echo "False"
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion checks the parent process ID against any process called 'screen', which may not accurately determine if the current shell is within a 'screen' session. The expert's completion traces the parent processes recursively to check for 'screen', which is more reliable."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print "True" if the contents of file /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt is a subset of file /testbed/dir2/subdir1/textfile2.txt, otherwise print "False"
LLM's completion: diff --new-line-format= --unchanged-line-format=F <(sort /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt) <(sort /testbed/dir2/subdir1/textfile2.txt) | awk 'END {print (NR==0?"True":"False")}'
Expert's completion: comm -23 <(sort /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt | uniq) <(sort /testbed/dir2/subdir1/textfile2.txt | uniq) | head -1 | grep -q '.' && echo "False" || echo "True"
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion first sorts both files and uses `diff` to check for differences, suppressing all lines except when differences occur. It uses an `awk` command to check if there are no differences, printing "True" if no differences are found and "False" otherwise, which implies a subset check. \n\nThe expert\'s completion uses `comm` with `-23` to check if sorted lines of the first file (with duplicates removed) are not present in the second file. If any line is found, it outputs "False", otherwise "True". Both methods effectively check if the content of the first file is a subset of the second, making the LLM\'s response faithful to the task.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Compute the mean average of the word count of *.txt files in the /testbed directory
LLM's completion: awk 'BEGIN { sum = 0; count = 0 } { sum += $1; count++ } END { print sum/count }' $(find /testbed -name "*.txt" | xargs wc)
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.txt' -print0 | xargs -0 wc -w | awk 'END { print $1/(NR-1) }'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion assumes that the output of `wc` is piped numbers, whereas `wc` produces filenames alongside the word counts. It also doesn't handle filenames with spaces correctly. It calculates the mean incorrectly by summing presumed numbers and counting them directly. Meanwhile, the expert's completion correctly calculates word counts from filenames, adequately handling spaces and calculating the mean accurately."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Compute the mean average of the word count of *.txt files smaller than 6 words in the /testbed directory
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -name "*.txt" | xargs wc -w | awk '$1 < 6' | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum/NR}'
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.txt' -print0 | xargs -0 wc -w | awk '$1 < 6 {v += $1; c++} END {print v/c}'
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s code logicually captures the task requirements:\n\n1. `find /testbed -type f -name "*.txt"` locates all .txt files under /testbed.\n2. `xargs wc -w` counts words in the files.\n3. `awk \'$1 < 6\'` filters files with less than 6 words.\n4. `awk \'{sum += $1} END {print sum/NR}\'` calculates the mean word count.\n\nIt performs the essential steps of finding files, counting words, filtering, summing, and averaging, consistent with the description.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Copy all files with "FooBar" in the path under the '/testbed' directory to the '/testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp' directory.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*FooBar*' -exec cp {} /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -path '*FooBar*' -print0 | xargs -0 -I{} cp -r {} /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `-name` option, which searches for files with names matching the pattern '*FooBar*', instead of using `-path` to match any part of the path. This might result in not finding all files that have 'FooBar' anywhere in their path. The expert's solution correctly uses `-path`. Additionally, the expert uses `-print0` and `xargs -0` for handling file names with spaces. The LLM's version lacks this robustness."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for all .txt files in the /testbed directory, prints their paths, and then search within each file for the word "another"
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.txt' -print | xargs grep another
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.txt" \( -exec echo {} \; -o -exec true \; \) -exec grep another {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion does not faithfully execute the task because it does not print the paths of the .txt files separately before searching within each file for the word "another." The use of `xargs grep another` will try to execute `grep` directly on the found paths, which merges finding and searching steps, and does not ensure the explicit printing of paths as required.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Convert the first 16 characters in "/testbed/textfile7.txt" to a single hexadecimal value
LLM's completion: xxd -p -l 16 /testbed/textfile7.txt | head -c 32
Expert's completion: head /testbed/textfile7.txt -c16 | od -tx1 -w16 | head -n1 | cut -d' ' -f2- | tr -d ' '
is_faithful=True explanation='Both the LLM\'s and the expert\'s completions aim to convert the first 16 characters of "/testbed/textfile7.txt" to a hexadecimal representation. \n\n1. **LLM\'s Completion:**\n   - Uses `xxd` to dump the file in a hexdump format (`-p` for plain hex), limiting the conversion to the first 16 bytes (`-l 16`). \n   - Then, it pipes the output to `head -c 32` to ensure it captures the full 32-character hex output.\n\n2. **Expert\'s Completion:**\n   - Uses `head` to extract the first 16 bytes (`-c16`), then `od` to convert this to a hex dump (`-tx1` for hex, `-w16` for word width).\n   - `head -n1` and `cut` extract the relevant hex values, followed by `tr` to remove spaces.\n\nBoth methods effectively obtain the hex representation of the first 16 characters. The LLM\'s approach is a more concise method using `xxd`, while the expert\'s method is more decomposed but achieves the same result.\nThus, the LLM\'s completion is faithful to the task.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Copies all files under the /testbed folder like "file.txt" with "FooBar" in the path to the root of the current folder, preserving mode, ownership and timestamp attributes.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name 'file.txt' -exec cp --parents {} . \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -path '*FooBar*' | xargs -i cp -p "{}" .
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'find /testbed -name 'file.txt'' to locate files named 'file.txt', but it does not filter for 'FooBar' in the file path. It also uses 'cp --parents {} .' which would not necessarily meet the requirement to copy with preserved mode, ownership, and timestamp without additional options, although '--preserve' might apply if included. The expert's completion correctly uses 'find /testbed -type f -path '*FooBar*'' to locate files with 'FooBar' in the path and 'cp -p' to preserve the required attributes."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Copy all files and folders below the /testbed directory whose names contain "FooBar" to directory '/testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp'
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*FooBar*' | xargs -I {} cp -r {} /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*FooBar*' -print0 | xargs -0 -I{} cp -R {} /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion and the Expert's completion both use the `find` command to locate files and folders with names containing 'FooBar' under the `/testbed` directory and copy them to the specified destination.\n\nDifferences:\n\n1. **xargs Handling:**\n   - The Expert's completion uses `-print0` with `find` and `xargs -0` to safely handle filenames with spaces or special characters.\n   - The LLM's completion does not handle such cases, which might lead to issues if the filenames include spaces or special characters.\n\n2. **cp Command Flags:**\n   - The Expert's uses `-R`, while the LLM's uses `-r`. Both flags work for recursive copying in `cp`, but `-R` is the standard POSIX-compliant form.\n\nDespite these differences, for filenames without spaces or special characters, the LLM's completion will function correctly, performing the intended task. Thus, it is considered faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count all the lines of all '*.c' files in /testbed directory recursively
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.c' -exec cat {} \; | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.c" -print0 | xargs -0 cat | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` with `-exec cat {} \\;` to concatenate the contents of all '*.c' files found recursively in the /testbed directory, and then pipes the output to `wc -l` to count the lines. This faithfully captures the task of counting all the lines in the '*.c' files recursively. The difference in method (using `-exec` vs. `-print0 | xargs -0`) doesn’t affect the correctness in this context."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count all the lines of all files with names ending with 'php' in current directory and subdirectories recursively
LLM's completion: find . -name '*.php' | xargs wc -l
Expert's completion: find . -type f -name '*php' | xargs cat | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion counts the total lines in each 'php' file, but treats each file as a separate entity. It does not use 'cat', leading to incorrect line count aggregation if multiple files are found. It counts lines in each file separately rather than aggregating them before counting the lines, which differs from the expert's method of concatenating all files first and then counting."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count all the lines of all php files in the /testbed directory recursively
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" | xargs wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed/ -name '*.php' | xargs cat | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion counts the lines in each PHP file separately and provides a total for each file. The expert's completion concatenates all PHP files into one stream and then counts the lines together, providing a total line count across all files. The LLM's version doesn't aggregate the line counts across all PHP files into a single number."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5sum of all '*.py' files in /testbed folder and sub folders.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.py' -exec md5sum {} \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -name "*.py" -exec md5sum {} +
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion faithfully captures the task of calculating the md5sum for all '*.py' files in the /testbed directory and its subdirectories. The use of `find /testbed -name '*.py' -exec md5sum {} \\;` will iterate over all Python files and apply `md5sum` to each, achieving the desired outcome. While slightly different in syntax from the expert's use of `+`, which is typically more efficient, the primary functionality is preserved, making it a faithful translation."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the *.html files residing in the /testbed directory tree and containing string "foo"
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.html" | xargs grep -l "foo" | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.html" | xargs grep -l foo | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion faithfully fulfills the task. Both the LLM\'s and the expert\'s translations are functionally equivalent, as they use `find` to locate all `.html` files, `grep` to filter files containing the string "foo", and `wc -l` to count the results. The slight difference in quoting "foo" does not affect the operation.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of files/directories with '.php' extension under /testbed directory tree and change the permissions to 755
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -name '*.php' | wc -l && find /testbed -type f -name '*.php' -exec chmod 755 {} \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" -exec chmod 755 {} \; -exec /bin/echo {} \; | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion counts only files with '.php' extensions, not directories, while the natural language description asked to count both files and directories. Additionally, it changes permissions only for files with '.php' extensions. The expert's completion addresses both files and directories."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of lines in all files in the /testbed directory tree that match pattern '*file*'
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -name '*file*' | xargs wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed/ -name '*file*' | sort | xargs wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the Expert's completions use 'find' to search for files in the /testbed directory that match the pattern '*file*'. They then use 'xargs' and 'wc -l' to count the lines in these files.\n\nThe main difference is that the Expert's completion includes 'sort' between 'find' and 'xargs', which sorts the files before counting lines. However, the sorting does not affect the correctness of counting the number of lines, making the LLM's solution faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of regular files in directory tree ${DIRECTORY} that contain a vowel in their names
LLM's completion: find ${DIRECTORY} -type f -name '*[aeiouAEIOU]*' | wc -l
Expert's completion: find ${DIRECTORY} -type f -print | sed -e 's@^.*/@@' | grep '[aeiouyAEIOUY]' | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the find command to search for files with vowels in their names directly using the `-name` option. This approach covers both lowercase and uppercase vowels, aligning well with the natural language description by counting files containing a vowel in their names.\n\nThe expert's solution separates the extraction of filenames and checking for vowels in names into distinct steps using `sed` and `grep`. While the expert's method may use extra steps, both solutions effectively count files with vowels in names, rendering the LLM's completion faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of files for each unique file extensions in the /testbed directory tree.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f | sed -e 's/.*\.//' | sed -e 's/.*\///' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion counts files by their extensions but doesn't account for files without extensions. The expert's solution filters out cases where a path doesn't contain a dot by ensuring that only extensions are selected after a slash. Additionally, the expert's version sorts the results by count, while the LLM's does not."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the total number of lines in all "*.gz" files in the /testbed directory tree after decompression
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -name "*.gz" | xargs -I {} zcat {} | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -name '*.gz' | xargs zcat | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. Both the LLM and the expert use `find` to locate all '*.gz' files in the /testbed directory, `zcat` to decompress them, and `wc -l` to count the lines. The difference with the `-I {}` option in `xargs` in the LLM's version does not affect the faithfulness to the task, as it essentially serves the same purpose in this context."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count lines in each *.php file sorted by file in /testbed directory.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -iname '*.php' -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -n
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' -type f | sort | xargs wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'sort -n', which sorts by line count rather than by file name. The Expert's completion sorts the file names first and then counts the lines, faithfully following the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts lines in each *.php file in /testbed directory, sorted by number of lines, descending.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -nr
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' -type f | xargs wc -l | sort -nr
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion effectively fulfills the task:\n\n1. **Directory and File Type:** Both solutions correctly use `find /testbed -name '*.php'` to locate PHP files in the /testbed directory.\n\n2. **Counting Lines:** Both use `wc -l` to count lines in the files.\n\n3. **Sorting Output:** Both use `sort -nr` to sort the results by number of lines in descending order.\n\nThe key difference is that the LLM uses `-exec` to apply `wc -l` directly to each file found, while the expert uses `xargs` to pipe all found files to `wc -l` at once. Both approaches achieve the desired output."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts number of occurences of all ip addresses in '/etc/networks' file, and prints all addresses with number of occurences in a descending order.
LLM's completion: cat /etc/networks | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
Expert's completion: grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' /etc/networks | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful because it assumes IP addresses are in the second column and uses `cut -d ' ' -f 2`, which may not correctly extract IP addresses if they are in a different position or if the file is not strictly formatted with spaces. The expert's completion uses `grep` with a regex to accurately extract all possible IP address patterns from the file, ensuring that every occurrence is counted."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts total number of only lines with alphanumeric symbols in all *.php files in the /testbed folder and subfolders.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' | xargs grep -E '^[a-zA-Z0-9]' | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' | xargs cat | awk '/[a-zA-Z0-9]/ {i++} END{print i}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion counts lines starting with an alphanumeric character, not just containing them, while the expert's completion counts any line that contains alphanumeric characters."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts total lines in PHP and JS files in /testbed.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' -o -name '*.js' | xargs wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.js' -or -name '*.php' | xargs wc -l | grep 'total'  | awk '{print $1}'
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion effectively counts the total lines in both PHP and JS files by using `find` to locate the files and `xargs wc -l` to count the lines. Although it doesn't explicitly filter to only show the total using `grep` and `awk`, the core functionality of counting is present and implicit in the output of `wc -l` when multiple files are used."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create an empty file "abc.txt" in each directory named "dir1" under testbed directory.
LLM's completion: find testbed -type d -name dir1 -exec touch {}/abc.txt \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type d -name "dir1" -print |  sed 's/$/\/abc.txt/g' | xargs touch
is_faithful=True explanation='Both the LLM\'s completion and the expert\'s completion correctly search for directories named "dir1" under the "testbed" directory and create an empty file named "abc.txt" within each found directory.\n\n- The LLM uses the `-exec` option of `find` to immediately execute the `touch` command on each directory found, which is effectively equivalent to the expert\'s pipeline approach.\n\n- The expert uses a pipeline consisting of `sed` to modify the output to append \'/abc.txt\' and then `xargs` to pass these modified directory paths to `touch`.\n\nBoth methods achieve the same goal but in slightly different ways. The LLM\'s solution is a faithful and correct completion of the task as described.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create logs.tar.gz of all older than one day logs of Ubuntu
LLM's completion: find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime +1 | xargs tar -czf logs.tar.gz
Expert's completion: find /var/log/ -mtime +1 | xargs  tar -czvPf  /testbed/logs.tar.gz
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion and the expert's completion both aim to create a compressed archive of log files older than one day. The key steps in both solutions involve using 'find' to identify log files based on modification time and 'tar' to compress them.\n\nDifferences:\n- The LLM's completion specifies looking for files with a .log extension, while the expert's completion does not.\n- The LLM's output file 'logs.tar.gz' is stored in the current working directory, while the expert hardcodes '/testbed/logs.tar.gz' as the output path.\n\nSince the LLM's completion meets the primary goal of the task as described, it is considered faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Delete files in "/testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp" that are older than 2 days
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp -type f -mtime +2 -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/tmp -type f -mtime +2 -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` to locate files older than 2 days and deletes them using `-exec rm {} \\;`. This accomplishes the task as specified by the natural language description. The expert's solution also uses `find` but pipes the results to `xargs` to handle files with potential special characters. Both solutions are valid for deleting the files, so the LLM’s completion is faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the 5 largest files in the /testbed directory and its sub-directories.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec du {} + | sort -rh | head -n 5
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec du -b {} + | sort -rh | head -n 5
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is effectively faithful to the task. It uses `find` to locate files and `du` to determine file sizes, then sorts them in reverse order and displays the top 5. While the expert's command specifies the size in bytes with `-b`, omitting it defaults to a human-readable format. Both accomplish the primary goal of identifying the 5 largest files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the 5 smallest files in the /testbed directory and its sub-directories ignoring any empty files.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -not -empty -printf '%s %p\n' | sort -n | head -5
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -size +0c -exec du -b {} + | sort -n | head -n 5
is_faithful=True explanation="Both solutions correctly identify non-empty files and sort them by size. The LLM's use of `-not -empty` is equivalent to the expert's `-size +0c`. The `-printf '%s %p\\n'` in the LLM's solution directly outputs the file sizes and paths, while the expert's `du -b` provides the sizes similarly. Thus, the LLM's completion is a faithful translation."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the 5 smallest files in the /testbed directory and its sub-directories.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f | xargs ls -lhS | head -n 5
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec ls -s {} \; | sort -n  | head -5
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion lists files by size using `ls -lhS`, which sorts files by size in descending order, showing the largest files first. Then, it uses `head -n 5`, which retrieves the first five entries. The result is the five largest files, not the smallest.\n\nThe expert's completion correctly uses `find` to execute `ls -s` on each file, sorts them numerically in ascending order, and then uses `head -5` to get the smallest files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the five biggest file sizes only in the /testbed directory
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f | xargs du -h | sort -hr | head -n 5

is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion uses `find testbed -name "*.java" | xargs grep -l "Hello"`, which searches for `.java` files in the `testbed` directory tree that contain \'Hello\', and prints their names. However, it only prints the path to the file and requires the filename from `basename`. The Expert\'s version not only finds and lists the files containing \'Hello\', but also makes sure to print just the filenames using `basename`. The Expert\'s approach is more comprehensive.'

----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print all unique file paths under "testbed/dir1" compared to "testbed/dir2"
LLM's completion: diff -u <(find testbed/dir1 -type f | sort) <(find testbed/dir2 -type f | sort)

The expert's solution correctly specifies this.\n\nAdditionally,\n- The use of `ls -l` and `grep -E 's'` in the LLM's command intends to check for the sticky bit but it is unnecessary when `find` can directly use the mode 1553.\n- The expert's solution correctly searches for files with mode 1553."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for php files in /testbed directory and search for "world" in all these files
LLM's completion: find /testbed -name "*.php" | xargs grep world
Expert's completion: find /testbed -name '*.php' -exec grep -iq "world" {} \; -print
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `xargs`, which will send file names to `grep`. However, it will not correctly handle filenames with spaces, and it outputs all lines containing 'world', not just the filenames. The expert’s version uses `-exec` with `-iq`, searching quietly for 'world' and printing only the filenames, ensuring correct handling of all file names."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively finds all files with any cased text "Hello" in the '/system/folder1' folder, and precedes found string with its number in file.
LLM's completion: grep -rni "Hello" /system/folder1
Expert's completion: grep -inr "Hello" /system/folder1
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion `grep -rni "Hello" /system/folder1` correctly uses `grep` to recursively search through the files in the \'/system/folder1\' directory for the string "Hello", ignoring case(`-i`) and including line numbers in the output(`-n`). This matches the requirements given in the natural language description.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively finds all files with whole word "foo" in the '/system', and precedes found string with its number in file.
LLM's completion: grep -rnw /system -e 'foo'
Expert's completion: grep -rnw /system -e "foo"
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion is faithful to the task. \n\nBoth the LLM\'s and the expert\'s translations correctly use the `grep` command with the `-r` option for recursive search and `-n` to prefix each line of output with the line number. The `-w` option ensures only whole words are matched in the \'/system\' directory using the search pattern \'foo\'.\n\nThe content and functionality of the code – i.e., recursively finding files with the whole word \'foo\' and showing the line number before the matched string – are the same in both translations. The difference in quotation marks (\' vs. ") does not affect the command\'s functionality in this context.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively list contents of the '/system' directory in a tree-like format
LLM's completion: adb shell run-as com.example.app tree -C /system
Expert's completion: tree /system
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'adb shell run-as com.example.app tree -C /system', which involves running a command on an Android device or emulator with a specific application context. This is not faithful to the task of simply listing the contents of '/system' in a tree-like format. The expert's solution 'tree /system' correctly addresses the task by directly invoking the 'tree' command on a Unix-based system."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively print all files and directories in the '/system/folder2' directory tree including hidden files
LLM's completion: find /system/folder2 -print
Expert's completion: tree -a /system/folder2
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion 'find /system/folder2 -print' lists all files and directories, including hidden ones, recursively. However, it doesn't print them in a structured tree format. The expert's use of 'tree -a' displays the tree structure, which is a closer interpretation of 'recursively print' in the context of visual representation."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively prints all folders in the '/system' folder that contain files like "*.out".
LLM's completion: find /system -type d -exec sh -c 'ls "$0"/*.out > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "$0"' {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system -type f -name "*.out" -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 dirname | sort -u
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM solution prints directories that contain .out files, meeting the description's surface requirements. However, it may not handle certain cases like directories with spaces in their names or directories with no .out files but subdirectories with them. The expert version reliably lists unique directories by first finding .out files, extracting their directory names, and then ensuring uniqueness with sorting, which is more robust for the task described. Therefore, while the LLM completion achieves the basic output, it lacks the same level of precision and reliability as the expert completion."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all "*.txt" files in the '/system' folder and answer "y" to any prompt
LLM's completion: find /system -type f -name "*.txt" -exec rm -rf {} \; | xargs -I {} echo y
Expert's completion: yes y | rm -r /system/*.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` to locate and remove files, but it inappropriately uses `xargs` and `echo y`, which does not ensure automatic 'yes' responses to prompts from `rm`. The expert's completion uses `yes y` to continuously provide 'y' as input, ensuring prompts are answered affirmatively, which aligns with the task requirements."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively removes all empty folders under /system/folder3/temp, printing info message on each operation, and suppressing error messages if folder is not empty.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -type d -empty -exec rm -rf {} \; -print 2>/dev/null
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -type d -empty -exec rmdir -vp --ignore-fail-on-non-empty {} +
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `rm -rf` to remove directories, which does not precisely match 'removes all empty folders,' as it would remove non-empty directories if executed. The expert solution uses `rmdir` with `--ignore-fail-on-non-empty`, ensuring only empty directories are removed and error messages are suppressed correctly."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively removes all files in the /system/folder1 folder but '*txt' files.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -type f ! -name "*txt" -exec rm -rf {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -type f -not -name '*txt' | xargs rm
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion accurately captures the requirement to remove all files except those matching \'*txt\'. The use of `find` with `-type f` ensures it targets files, `! -name "*txt"` excludes files ending in \'txt\', and `-exec rm -rf {} \\;` removes them, which matches the intent of the natural language description.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively rename all files under /system/folder2 replacing special with regular.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder2 -type f -execdir rename 's/special/regular/' {} +
Expert's completion: find /system/folder2 -type f -name '*special*' ! -path '*/special/*' -execdir bash -c 'mv "$0" "${0/special/regular}"' {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the 'rename' command, assuming availability of the command and does not specify renaming only files with 'special' in their names. The expert's completion uses 'mv' and includes conditions to target only files with 'special' in their name, ensuring a more precise and controlled renaming, which makes it more aligned with the description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively search for all regular files below directory "/system/folder3/", and output the name of each, without any containing directories.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder3/ -type f -printf "%f\n"
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/ -type f -exec basename {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion uses the `-printf` option with "%f\\n", which directly outputs the filenames without directories, aligning with the task requirement to output only the names of the files. The expert\'s use of `-exec basename {} \\;` achieves the same result by extracting filenames using `basename`. Both accomplish the task faithfully.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Recursively unzip files to stdout in "/system/folder2.tar.gz" and search for "special"
LLM's completion: find /system/folder2.tar.gz -name "*zip" -exec zcat {} \; | grep "special"
Expert's completion: zcat -r /system/folder2.tar.gz | grep "special"
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion suggests using `find` to look for zip files and using `zcat` only for those, while the task specifies operating on a tar.gz file specifically and recursively unzipping its contents, which is what the expert's completion does. Additionally, `zcat` is typically not used for zip files but for files compressed with gzip."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove "\r" at the end of each line in "system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt" and display the result as printable characters or backslash escapes
LLM's completion: sed -e 's/\r$//' system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt | od -c
Expert's completion: cat /system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt | sed 's/\r$//' | od -c
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `sed` to remove '\\r' from the end of each line in the file and then pipes the result to `od -c` to display it as printable characters or backslash escapes. This matches the functionality of the expert's completion, which achieves the same end result. The difference in the initial command (`cat` vs. direct `sed` invocation) does not affect the output, making the LLM's response faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.doc files from the /system/folder1 tree
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -name '*.doc' | xargs rm -rf
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -name '*.doc' -exec rm "{}" \;
is_faithful=True explanation='Both the LLM\'s completion and the expert\'s completion correctly find and remove all *.doc files from the /system/folder1 directory tree. The key difference is in the method of removal: the LLM uses `xargs` to pass the files to `rm`, while the expert uses `-exec rm "{}" \\;`. Both methods are valid and effectively accomplish the task.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.log files from the /system/folder1 tree
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -type f -name "*.log" -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -name '*.log' -print0 | xargs -0 rm
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful. It uses the 'find' command to locate '.log' files and removes them with the 'rm' command. The '-type f' ensures only files are found, and '-exec rm {} \\;' executes the removal immediately for each file. It achieves the same result as the expert's method, which uses 'xargs'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.txt files in '/system' directory but not in it's subdirectories
LLM's completion: find /system -maxdepth 1 -name '*.txt' -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system -name '*.txt' -maxdepth 1 | xargs rm
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. It uses `find` with `-maxdepth 1` to ensure only files in the '/system' directory and not its subdirectories are removed. The `-name '*.txt'` option specifies that only .txt files should be selected, and `-exec rm {} \\;` is used to remove the files. This matches the intent of the given task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.sql files in the '/system/folder3/backup_dbg' directory that were last modified more than 25 days ago
LLM's completion: find /system/folder3/backup_dbg -name '*.sql' -mtime +25 -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/backup_dbg/*.sql -mtime +25 -exec rm -f {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses `find` to search for '*.sql' files under '/system/folder3/backup_dbg'. It includes the conditions `-name '*.sql'` and `-mtime +25`, and it executes `rm` to delete the files. The use of `-exec rm {} \\;` is a standard way to remove the found files, making it functionally equivalent to the expert's completion."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.txt files under the /system/folder1 directory modified more than 5 minutes ago
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -type f -name "*.txt" -mmin +5 -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -mmin +5 -type f -name "*.txt" -delete
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM and the expert's translations correctly identify and remove `.txt` files modified more than 5 minutes ago in the specified directory. The LLM's use of `-exec rm {} \\;` is equivalent to the expert's `-delete` option. Both achieve the intended result."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all *.txt files, except "keep.txt", under /system/folder1 directory modified more than 5 minutes ago. Do not include subdirectories.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -type f -mmin +5 -name "*.txt" ! -name "keep.txt" -exec rm -f {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -maxdepth 1 -mmin +5 -type f -name "*.txt" ! -name "keep.txt" -delete
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not include the '-maxdepth 1' option, which means it can recurse into subdirectories, contrary to the requirement of not including subdirectories."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all .sh files in the '/system/folder1' tree whose names begin with "new"
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -name 'new*.sh' -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -name 'new*.sh' -exec rm -f '{}' \;
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion faithfully captures the task of removing all .sh files beginning with 'new' in the '/system/folder1' tree. Both the LLM's and expert's scripts use the 'find' command to search for files matching the pattern 'new*.sh' and execute 'rm' to delete them. The LLM's completion does not include the '-f' flag, but it's not required to fulfill the specified task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all a.out, *.o, and core files under the '/system' directory
LLM's completion: find /system -name a.out -o -name '*.o' -o -name core -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system \( -name a.out -o -name '*.o' -o -name 'core' \) -exec rm {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion lacks parentheses around the name conditions. This could lead to unexpected behavior if there are other options or filters, as the precedence of operators like '-o' might not work as intended without grouping."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the last five lines of /system/folder1/data.csv
LLM's completion: tail -n 5 /system/folder1/data.csv
Expert's completion: cat /system/folder1/data.csv | rev | cut -d, -f-5 | rev
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `tail -n 5 /system/folder1/data.csv`, which correctly prints the last five lines of the file, directly addressing the task.\n\nThe Expert's completion uses a complex method involving `cat`, `rev`, and `cut`, but it doesn't relate to printing the last five lines. The approach appears to be incorrect as it does not fulfill the task requirement. The Expert's completion isn't faithful to the original task, while the LLM's is."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all directories called "temp" from the /system directory tree
LLM's completion: find /system -type d -name temp | xargs rm -rf
Expert's completion: find /system -name "temp" -type d -delete
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion is faithful to the task. It uses the `find` command to locate directories named "temp" and then utilizes `xargs` with `rm -rf` to remove them. This achieves the same result as the expert\'s completion, which directly uses `find` with the `-delete` option.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all empty files in /system/folder3/temp and below
LLM's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -type f -empty -delete
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -type f -empty -print | xargs rm -f
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. Both the LLM's and the Expert's solutions correctly identify and remove empty files within `/system/folder3/temp` and its subdirectories. The LLM's method directly uses `-delete` for removal, while the Expert's solution uses `xargs rm -f` after listing the files with `-print`. Both achieve the desired outcome."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all files a.out and *.o in the /system directory tree that were modified less than 7 days ago
LLM's completion: find /system -type f \( -name a.out -o -name "*.o" \) -mtime -7 -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system \( -name a.out -o -name '*.o' \) -mtime -7 -exec rm {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions aim to find and remove files named 'a.out' and '*.o' in the /system directory that were modified less than 7 days ago. The LLM's completion includes the '-type f' option, which explicitly restricts the search to regular files. This does not alter the fundamental task requirement of removing matching files, so it remains faithful to the original request. The LLM's addition simply refines the search but remains faithful to the core intent of the command."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all files and directories under '/system/folder3/temp' directory tree that match with one of the name patterns '.DS_Store', '._.DS_Store' , '._*', '.TemporaryItems' or '.apdisk'
LLM's completion: find /system/folder3/temp -type f -name ".DS_Store" -o -name "._.DS_Store" -o -name "._*" -o -name ".TemporaryItems" -o -name ".apdisk" | xargs rm -rf
Expert's completion: find /system/folder3/temp \( -name '.DS_Store' -or -name '._.DS_Store' -or -name '._*' -or -name '.TemporaryItems' -or -name '.apdisk' \) -exec rm -rf {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `xargs rm -rf`, which is not entirely safe for file names with special characters or spaces. It focuses on files (`-type f`), while the task requires removing both files and directories. The expert's completion correctly handles both files and directories and safely removes them using `-exec rm -rf {} \\;`. Additionally, it uses parentheses to group the `-name` tests, ensuring correct precedence."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove everything within parentheses and substitute all non digit characters with a space from "1/2 [3] (27/03/2012 19:32:54) word word word word 4/5" and format the output as a table
LLM's completion: echo '1/2 [3] (27/03/2012 19:32:54) word word word word 4/5' | sed -E 's/\([^)]+\)//g' | tr -cd '[:digit:] \t\n' | column -t
Expert's completion: echo '1/2 [3] (27/03/2012 19:32:54) word word word word 4/5' | sed -e 's/(.*)//' -e 's/[^0-9]/ /g' | column -t
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion removes all characters except digits and spaces ('[:digit:] \\t\\n'), which alters the original prompt's meaning. The expert's completion substitutes non-digit characters with spaces, which maintains more of the input structure as requested, after removing content in parentheses."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove files text2, text3, text4 in directory /system/folder1
LLM's completion: adb shell rm -f /system/folder1/text2 text3 text4
Expert's completion: find /system/folder1 -name 'text[2-4]*' -exec rm {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion assumes the context of an Android environment and uses 'adb shell' to execute the command, which may not be appropriate. It also incorrectly specifies the file paths; only 'text2' has a full path, while 'text3' and 'text4' do not. The expert's completion uses 'find' to precisely locate and remove files that match the pattern 'text[2-4]*', which is more robust and aligns with the original task's intent to remove files specifically named 'text2', 'text3', and 'text4' within a specified directory."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove files that are less than 1KB in size under /system directory
LLM's completion: find /system -type f -size -1k -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system -type f -size -1k -exec rm {} +
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion and the expert's completion use the `find` command to locate files in the `/system` directory that are less than 1KB in size and then remove them.\n\n- The LLM uses `-exec rm {} \\;` to execute the removal of each file individually.\n- The expert uses `-exec rm {} +` which batches the removal command for better efficiency.\n\nBoth methods correctly fulfill the task as described in the natural language description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print "/system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt" without newline characters.
LLM's completion: echo -n /system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt
Expert's completion: paste -sd "" /system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion `echo -n /system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt` prints the path as a string without a newline. However, it doesn\'t address removing newlines from the file content itself. The expert\'s completion `paste -sd "" /system/folder3/temp/temp1/text1.txt` removes newline characters from the content of the file and prints it, which aligns with the task.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove regular files in the /system directory tree
LLM's completion: find /system -type f -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /system -type f -exec rm {} +
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the expert's and the LLM's completions use the `find` command to locate regular files (`-type f`) and remove them. The difference between `-exec rm {} \\;` and `-exec rm {} +` is mainly in efficiency. The first executes `rm` for each file found, while the latter groups them to run `rm` fewer times. Both accomplish the task correctly."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print amount of space available on the file system containing path to the /system directory in megabytes.
LLM's completion: df --output=avail /system | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $1/1024}'
Expert's completion: df -m /system
is_faithful=False explanation="The expert's solution uses `df -m /system` to directly display available space in megabytes. The LLM's solution calculates it by dividing the kilobyte value from `df --output=avail` by 1024, which is error-prone and may not match the system's default `df` behavior (which could vary by system). The expert's solution is more direct and effectively uses the `-m` flag to ensure megabyte output."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the number of sub-directories under /system
LLM's completion: ls /system | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /system -type d | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion (`ls /system | wc -l`) counts all items (files and directories) within the `/system` directory, not just the sub-directories. The expert's completion (`find /system -type d | wc -l`) counts only the directories, which accurately fulfills the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Archive all files in /system/folder1 directory modified in the last 60 days to "/mytarfile.tgz" with a time of 2023-01-01, owner of 0, and group of 0.
LLM's completion: find /system/folder1 -mtime -60 -print0 | xargs -0 tar --warning=no-file-changed --warning=no-file-removed --warning=no-file-same-permissions --warning=no-file-same-owner --warning=no-file-same-time --warning=no-file-same-group --warning=no-file-same-type --warning=no-file-same-size --warning=no-file-same-links --warning=no-file-same-uid --warning=no-file-same-gid --warning=no-file-same-mode --warning=no-file-same-acl --warning=no-file-same-xattr --warning=no-file-same-security
Expert's completion: tar --mtime='2023-01-01' --owner=0 --group=0 -czf mytarfile.tgz `find /system/folder1 -mtime -60`
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation uses 'find' to locate files modified in the last 60 days, but it does not accurately incorporate them into a tar command. It includes excessive and incorrect warning options and fails to create an archive with the specified date, owner, and group. The Expert's completion correctly uses 'tar' with the correct options, setting the modification time, owner, and group as required."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a symbolc link in the /system/folder1 to root folder
LLM's completion: ln -s /root /system/folder1
Expert's completion: ln /system/folder1 -s /
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's translation attempts to create a symbolic link under /system/folder1 pointing to /root. However, it swaps the order of the destination and link name compared to a typical use of lm -s which would be ln -s [target] [link name]."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Write the current date and time followed by " 1" to the console and append to "/system/folder3/temp/empty.txt"
LLM's completion: date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S 1" | tee -a /system/folder3/temp/empty.txt
Expert's completion: echo $(date) "1" | tee -a /system/folder3/temp/empty.txt
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s translation uses `date` with a format string to output the date and time followed by " 1". The use of `tee -a` to append to "/system/folder3/temp/empty.txt" matches the expert\'s use of `tee -a`, and both direct their output to the console as well. The minor difference in formatting of the date command is acceptable since it still captures the essence of \'current date and time\', thus the LLM\'s translation is faithful to the task.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Concatenate all .txt files residing in the /system tree into a single file "/system/folder3/temp/concat.txt"
LLM's completion: find /system -type f -name "*.txt" -exec cat {} \; > /system/folder3/temp/concat.txt
Expert's completion: find /system -name "*.txt" -not -name "concat.txt" -print -exec cat {} \; > /system/folder3/temp/concat.txt
is_faithful=False explanation='The LLM\'s completion does not exclude the target file \'concat.txt\' from being included in the operation. The expert\'s completion makes use of the \'-not -name "concat.txt"\' to prevent this potential issue. This makes the LLM\'s translation not fully faithful to the task.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Compresses all the files in the /system folder with default depth to /backup using cpio.
LLM's completion: find /system -depth | cpio -o -H newc > /backup/system.cpio
Expert's completion: find /system -depth -print | cpio -dump /backup
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `cpio` with the `-o -H newc` options to create an archive, but specifies output to a single file (`/backup/system.cpio`). This is not equivalent to copying files into a directory while maintaining structure. It compresses files into a single archive file.\n\nThe expert's completion uses `find` to list files and `cpio -dump /backup` to replicate the directory structure in `/backup`, reflecting a more faithful interpretation if the task was to copy or move files, not create a single archive file. Thus, the LLM's version changes the functionality from copying to archiving."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Dump "/system/text1.txt" as ASCII characters
LLM's completion: adb shell dumpsys meminfo --pid=1234 --dump-text1.txt
Expert's completion: od -t c /system/text1.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful. It uses `adb shell dumpsys meminfo --pid=1234 --dump-text1.txt`, which is not appropriate for dumping a file as ASCII characters. The correct command, according to the expert, is `od -t c /system/text1.txt`, which accurately converts the file contents to ASCII."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a compressed archive of /system/folder1 "compress_folder1.tar.gz" with a time of 2023-01-01, owner of 0, and group of 0.

is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions perform the same actions: they create a compressed (gzip) tarball named 'compress_folder1.tar.gz' from the folder '/system/folder1', setting the modification time to '2023-01-01', and setting the owner and group to 0. The order of options differs, but this does not change the functionality."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: download content from "http://example.com/textfile.txt" and output to 'textfile.txt' in /system
LLM's completion: curl -o /system/textfile.txt http://example.com/textfile.txt
Expert's completion: curl http://example.com/textfile.txt -o /system/textfile.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `-o` option to specify the output file path, which matches the intended behavior of the expert's solution. Both commands will download the file from the URL and save it as 'textfile.txt' in the '/system' directory. The switch orders (-o before vs. after URL) are different but functionally equivalent in this context."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search in /system downwards all files whose size is greater than 10 bytes.
LLM's completion: find /system -size +10c
Expert's completion: find /system -size +10c -print
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find /system -size +10c`, which correctly searches for files greater than 10 bytes. The `-print` option in the expert's completion is not strictly necessary for the command to work, as `find` will list matching files by default. Thus, the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5sum of each ".txt" file under "/system" and sort the output.
LLM's completion: find /system -name "*.txt" | xargs md5sum | sort
Expert's completion: find /system -type f -name '*.txt' -exec md5sum {} + | awk '{print $1}' | sort
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion calculates the md5sum of each '.txt' file and sorts the entire line of output, including filenames. The expert's version calculates the md5sum and ensures sorting is based solely on the checksum by utilizing 'awk' to isolate and sort the checksum values."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for the system host name in "/etc/hosts" and print the IP address in the first awk field
LLM's completion: awk -v hst=$(hostname) '$2 == hst {print $1}' /etc/hosts
Expert's completion: more /etc/hosts | grep `hostname` | awk '{print $1}'
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's solutions aim to achieve the same goal: extracting the IP address associated with the system's host name from '/etc/hosts'. The LLM's completion uses AWK to directly match the host name and prints the corresponding IP address from the first field, which is a concise and correct approach. The expert's completion uses a pipeline to first filter lines with grep and then extract the IP address with awk, which is also correct. Both achieve the desired task, ensuring faithfulness."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find files in /workspace directory modified within 30 days.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -mtime -30
Expert's completion: find /workspace -daystart -type f -mtime -30
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is missing the '-type f' option, which is necessary to ensure only files are returned, and it also doesn't use '-daystart', which aligns the time calculation to the start of the current day. These omissions make the LLM's command less precise."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find files in the /workspace directory and sub-directories, that changed over an hour ago.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -mmin +60
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -cmin +60
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-mmin` which checks for the last modification time of files, while the natural language description specifies finding files based on change time ('changed over an hour ago'). The expert's completion uses `-cmin` which accurately reflects change time. Additionally, the LLM's command is missing `-type f` to ensure only files are found."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find files in the /workspace directory and sub-directories, that were accessed over an hour ago.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -amin +60
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -amin +60
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-amin +60`, which correctly finds files accessed over an hour ago but does not explicitly specify `-type f` to restrict results to regular files, as in the expert's completion."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list all the files in the /workspace directory which are of size 0 bytes.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -size 0c
Expert's completion: find /workspace -empty
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and expert's completions correctly find files of size 0 bytes in the /workspace directory. The LLM uses `-size 0c`, which specifies files of 0 bytes, while the expert uses `-empty`, which also matches files of size 0 bytes. Therefore, both are faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list all zero-length files under the /workspace directory
LLM's completion: find /workspace -size 0c
Expert's completion: find /workspace -empty -exec ls {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `find /workspace -size 0c` lists files of zero byte length. However, it does not specify file types, so it might include directories, devices, or links also having a size of zero bytes, depending on the filesystem characteristics. The expert's completion `find /workspace -empty -exec ls {} \\;` specifically looks for empty files (not directories) and lists them using `ls`. Therefore, the LLM's solution might not precisely adhere to listing only zero-length files, depending on the system and configuration."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: locate and remove large files (> 1 KB) in /workspace
LLM's completion: find /workspace -size +1k -exec rm {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -size +1k -delete
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion correctly uses the `find` command to locate files larger than 1 KB in `/workspace`. It uses `-exec rm {} \\;` to remove the files, which is a valid approach. However, the LLM's method may be less efficient compared to the expert's completion, which uses the `-delete` option. Both accomplish the task, but `-delete` is often preferred for simplicity and efficiency."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all the files in the /workspace directory which have only read permission to the group.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -perm g=r
Expert's completion: find /workspace -perm 400 -type f -exec ls -l {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion checks for files with exactly read permission for the group, but the permission mode `g=r` is not correct. It should be checking with mode `040`, corresponding to read permission for the group only. The expert's solution uses `-perm 400`, which only matches files with read permission for the owner, not the group.\n\nThe expert's completion also appears incorrect, as it does not properly address permissions for the group. It should include `-perm -g=r` or similar to ensure files are only group-readable."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all the files in the /workspace directory which have permissions 777.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -perm 777
Expert's completion: find /workspace -perm 777 -type f -exec ls -l {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly identifies files in the /workspace directory with permissions 777. The command `find /workspace -type f -perm 777` lists all files (of type f) meeting the stated permission criteria. While the expert's solution includes `-exec ls -l {}` to display detailed information, the core task of listing files is achieved by the LLM's answer as well."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List the details of all the text files in /workspace directory.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -name "*.txt" | xargs ls -l
Expert's completion: find /workspace -name "*.txt" -exec ls -ld {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion faithfully lists the details of all text files in the /workspace directory. It uses `find` to locate the files and then pipes them to `xargs ls -l`, similar to the expert's use of `find` with `-exec ls -ld`. Both solutions deliver the required outcome."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Move files in /workspace accessed less than one day ago to directory /.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -atime -1 -exec mv {} / \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -atime -1 -type f -exec mv {} / \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion will move both files and directories accessed less than one day ago, while the task specifies moving files only. The expert's completion restricts the operation to files using the `-type f` option, making it faithful to the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print all filenames of files under /workspace/dir1 dir containing 'hello', case-insensitive
LLM's completion: find /workspace/dir1 -type f | xargs grep -il 'hello'
Expert's completion: find /workspace/dir1 -type f -exec grep -il 'hello' {} \;
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's translations achieve the same goal: finding files under /workspace/dir1 that contain the word 'hello' in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nThe LLM's use of `xargs` with `find` lists all files and passes them to `grep`, which searches for 'hello'. The `-i` flag ensures case insensitivity, and `-l` ensures only filenames are printed.\n\nThe expert's version uses `-exec` with `find` to achieve the same result directly within each file found.\n\nBoth methods are correct and meet the requirements of the task in the description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print disk usage of files or folders in /workspace
LLM's completion: du -sh /workspace/*
Expert's completion: du -sh /workspace
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses '/workspace/*' which lists the disk usage of each item inside the '/workspace' directory, while the expert's completion 'du -sh /workspace' provides the total disk usage of the '/workspace' directory itself. The tasks are slightly different in scope, making the LLM's completion not fully faithful to the expert's intended task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print the last word in /workspace/dir1/long.txt
LLM's completion: awk 'END { print $NF }' /workspace/dir1/long.txt
Expert's completion: tac /workspace/dir1/long.txt | awk 'NF{print $NF; exit}'
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and Expert's bash commands are faithful to the task, as they effectively print the last word of the file. The LLM's solution uses 'awk' to achieve this by processing the entire file and printing the last field of the last line. The Expert's solution reverses the file, locates the first non-empty line, and then prints the last field. While the approaches differ, the LLM's solution is a straightforward and efficient method to achieve the desired outcome."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the 3 largest directories in /workspace.
LLM's completion: du -h --max-depth=1 | sort -hr | head -n 3
Expert's completion: du -a /workspace | sort -nr | head -n 3
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not restrict the directories to '/workspace', and it uses '--max-depth=1' which would list the sizes of directories and files directly under the current directory, not specifically '/workspace'. Also, it includes a human-readable option that alters sorting by size since '-h' (human-readable) would sort alphabetically by appending 'M', 'K', 'G', etc. The expert's version correctly specifies the path '/workspace' and uses 'du -a' to ensure it captures directories, not just immediate children, then sorts numerically to find the largest upon total size."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: prints first line of "/workspace/dir1/long.txt"
LLM's completion: head -n 1 /workspace/dir1/long.txt
Expert's completion: head -n1 /workspace/dir1/long.txt
is_faithful=True explanation='Both commands correctly use `head` to display the first line of the specified file. The difference between `-n 1` and `-n1` is purely stylistic, and both are functionally equivalent.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: prints the last non-empty line of "/workspace/dir1/a.txt"
LLM's completion: awk 'END {print NR}' /workspace/dir1/a.txt
Expert's completion: tac /workspace/dir1/a.txt | grep -m 1 '.'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion using `awk 'END {print NR}' /workspace/dir1/a.txt` prints the number of the last line, not the actual content of the last non-empty line. The expert's completion accurately inverts the file and uses `grep` to find the last non-empty line, which is the correct approach for the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: prune all the files in the /workspace directory
LLM's completion: prune -w /workspace
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -delete
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `prune` command, which does not exist for pruning files as described. The expert's completion uses `find` with `-type f -delete` to find and delete all files within the `/workspace` directory, which accurately performs the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for all the files in the  /workspace directory which have size greater than 1KB (approx) and less than 32KB(approx).
LLM's completion: find /workspace -size +1k -size -32k
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -size +1k -size -32k
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful to the task because it does not specify `-type f`, which is necessary to ensure only files are searched, not directories or other types."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for all the files in the  /workspace folder and sort them in the order of their depth and display the file names
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f | xargs -I {} echo $(echo {} | grep -o "/" | wc -l) {} | sort -n | awk '{print $2}'
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f | awk -F/ '{print NF, $0}' | sort -n
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion accurately follows the task. It finds all files in the `/workspace` directory, counts the depth by counting slashes, sorts them by this depth, and then displays the file names. Its method uses `xargs`, `grep`, and `wc` to count slashes, and `awk` to print the file names, which achieves the same outcome as the expert's use of `awk -F/` to count path depth directly."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for all the files in the /workspace folder which are bigger than 1KB and display the biggest file.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -size +1k | xargs ls -lhS | head -n 1
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -size +1k -exec ls -ls {} + | sort -n | tail -1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `ls -lhS` which sorts files by size but does not ensure it shows only the largest file due to possible limitations with `xargs`. The expert's version uses `sort -n` and `tail -1` to correctly identify and display the single largest file, making it more reliable for showing just the biggest file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for text files in the  /workspace folder which do not have write access to others
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -name '*.txt' ! -perm -o+w
Expert's completion: find  /workspace -type f \( -iname "*.txt" -not -perm -o=w \)
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly searches for text files in the /workspace directory that do not have write permission for others using:\n\n- `find /workspace -type f` to find files\n- `-name '*.txt'` to match text files\n- `! -perm -o+w` to exclude files with write permission for others.\n\nThe use of `! -perm -o+w` effectively checks for the absence of the write permission for others, which aligns with the expert's use of `-not -perm -o=w`. The differences in quoting styles for the file pattern and logical operators in the perm expression do not affect the functionality, making the LLM's completion faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for the directory "mysql" in the workspace directory.
LLM's completion: find $(cat ~/workspace/.vscode/settings.json | jq -r '.terminal.integrated.shellArgs.linux[0]') -name mysql
Expert's completion: find  /workspace -name mysql -type d
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses 'jq' to extract a shell argument from a VS Code configuration file, which is not related to the task of searching for a 'mysql' directory in the 'workspace' directory. It searches in an incorrect path and for potentially incorrect items."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print a list of all duplicate case insensitive filenames in the /workspace directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -iname '*' | sort | uniq -cd | sort -n | grep -v '^1'
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f | awk -F/ '{print $NF}' | sort -f | uniq -i -d
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion doesn't correctly address case insensitivity when checking for duplicates. It uses `-iname '*'`, which is unnecessary, and doesn't apply case insensitivity with `sort` or `uniq`. The expert uses `sort -f` and `uniq -i` for case insensitive matching specifically for filenames, which is aligned with the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for the file old2.txt in the /workspace folder and list its permissions and creation time.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -name "old2.txt" -exec ls -l {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -name old2.txt | xargs ls -tl
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion faithfully executes the task. It uses `find` to locate `old2.txt` and `ls -l` to list permissions and other file details, which includes creation time."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: search for the word "hello" in all the regular/normal files in the  /workspace folder and display the matched file name
LLM's completion: grep -r --include=\*.txt -l "hello" /workspace
Expert's completion: find  /workspace -type f | xargs grep -l "hello"
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion restricts the search to files with a .txt extension only due to the --include option. The original task requires searching all regular/normal files, without any specific extension filter. The expert's solution correctly searches all regular files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of all files in the /workspace directory with the filename printed first
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec sh -c 'md5sum "{}" | awk "{print $1, \"{}\"}"' \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec md5sum {} + | awk '{print $2 " " $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is not faithful to the task. It prints the md5 checksum first and then the filename, while the task requires the filename to be printed first. It uses an inline shell with 'sh -c', which complicates the solution. The Expert's completion orders the output correctly with awk, ensuring the filename is printed first, which aligns with the task description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the md5 sum of all files in directory tree "/workspace"
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec md5sum {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` to locate all files in the `/workspace` directory and then calculates the md5 checksum for each file using `md5sum`. This is faithful to the task of calculating md5 sums for all files in the directory tree.\n\nThe difference from the expert's completion is the lack of `sort`, which the expert includes. However, sorting the output is not required in the original task description. Thus, the LLM's completion is considered faithful as it correctly addresses the primary goal."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of unique 3 to 6 character file extensions are in the /workspace directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f | sed 's/.*\.//g' | grep -E '^[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,6}$' | sort | uniq | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -name '*.*' | awk -F. 'NF>1 {ext=tolower($NF); if (length(ext) >= 3 && length(ext) <= 6) print ext}' | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion extracts extensions by removing everything before the last dot but does not handle case insensitivity. It also includes extensions without filtering for alphanumeric characters only."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a copy of the /workspace directory structure in the /usr directory,
LLM's completion: cp -r /workspace/* /usr/
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type d -print|sed 's@^@/usr/@'|xargs mkdir -p
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion copies files and directories recursively from '/workspace' to '/usr', including the files. The task was to replicate only the directory structure, not the files themselves. The LLM command doesn't isolate directories; it could potentially overwrite existing files in '/usr' and doesn't accurately replicate the directory structure alone. The expert's completion specifically creates an empty directory structure in '/usr' that mirrors '/workspace' without copying any files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display a long listing of the oldest file under '/workspace' directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -printf "%T@ %p\n" | sort -n | head -1
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -printf '%T+ %p\n' | sort | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2}' | xargs ls -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion is almost correct in finding the oldest file but does not format the output as a long listing. It lists the oldest file by timestamp but doesn't use ls -l to display it in a long listing format."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find the largest 2 directories under /workspace directory
LLM's completion: du -sh /workspace/* | sort -h | tail -n 2
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type d -print0 | xargs -0 du | sort -n | tail -2 | cut -f2 | xargs -I{} du -sh {}
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion lists the largest directory contents, not directories themselves. It assumes top-level entries are directories and sorts them by size. The expert's solution correctly identifies directories at any level, sorts them by size, and prints the largest two."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all files with their paths that have identical content in /workspace directory
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort | uniq -w 32 --all-repeated=separate | awk '{print $3}'
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f | xargs md5sum | sort | uniq -Dw32
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions achieve the same task of listing files with identical content.\n\n1. **Hashing Files**:\n   - **LLM** uses `find /workspace -type f -exec md5sum {} +`, which executes `md5sum` on each file found by `find`.\n   - **Expert** uses `find /workspace -type f | xargs md5sum`, which also applies `md5sum` to each file.\n\n2. **Sorting and Finding Duplicates**:\n   - **LLM** pipes the result to `sort | uniq -w 32 --all-repeated=separate`.\n   - **Expert** performs `sort | uniq -Dw32`.\n   - Both methods use `sort` followed by `uniq` with a width of 32, targeting duplicate hashes.\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - **LLM** uses `awk '{print $3}'` to print only the file paths.\n   - **Expert** does not explicitly filter columns, but since `uniq -Dw32` would display duplicate lines, the outcome is effectively the same.\n\nThough there are minor variations (e.g., `xargs` vs. `-exec` and `awk` filtering), the LLM's completion faithfully meets the requirements."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Make directories for each unique file path in "/workspace/files.txt"
LLM's completion: cat /workspace/files.txt | xargs -I {} mkdir -p $(dirname {})
Expert's completion: cat /workspace/files.txt |xargs -I {} dirname "{}"| sort -u | xargs -I{} mkdir -p "{}"
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not handle the creation of unique directories. It attempts to directly create directories for each file path, which may result in duplicates. The expert's completion first extracts the unique directory paths with `dirname` and `sort -u`, ensuring only unique directories are created."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the total disk usage in bytes of all files listed in "/workspace/files.txt"
LLM's completion: du -ch $(cat /workspace/files.txt) | tail -1
Expert's completion: cat /workspace/files.txt | xargs du -b | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `du -ch`, which provides output in a human-readable format, not strictly in bytes. The command `tail -1` will take the overall total from the human-readable output, which may be in kilobytes, megabytes, etc., potentially leading to incorrect byte results. The expert's solution uses `du -b` to ensure the output is in bytes and processes the last line to extract the total disk usage in bytes accurately."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Unhide all hidden files in the /workspace directory. Do not include subdirectories.
LLM's completion: find /workspace -maxdepth 1 -name '.*' | xargs -I {} chattr -i {}
Expert's completion: find /workspace -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '.*' -exec sh -c 'mv "$0" "${0%/\.*}/${0##*/.}"' {} \;
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `chattr -i` which changes the immutable attribute of files if set. It does not unhide files as described. The expert's completion correctly renames the files to remove the leading dot, thereby un-hiding them."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of differing lines in "/workspace/dir1/long.txt" and "/workspace/dir1/terminate.txt"
LLM's completion: diff -u /workspace/dir1/long.txt /workspace/dir1/terminate.txt | grep -c '^>'
Expert's completion: diff /workspace/dir1/long.txt /workspace/dir1/terminate.txt | grep ^[\>\<] | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion only counts lines starting with '^>', which are the lines unique to the second file according to the unified diff format. It misses lines that start with '^<' (unique to the first file). The expert's completion correctly counts both added ('^>') and removed ('^<') lines using a regex to match either character."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of differing lines in "/workspace/dir1/terminate.txt" and "/workspace/dir1/long.txt" with 0 lines of unified context
LLM's completion: diff -U0 /workspace/dir1/terminate.txt /workspace/dir1/long.txt | grep ^@ | wc -l
Expert's completion: diff -U 0 /workspace/dir1/terminate.txt /workspace/dir1/long.txt | grep -v ^@ | wc -l
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion counts the number of hunks (changes blocks) by using `grep ^@`, which captures lines starting with '@'. This doesn't count differing lines directly but counts the groups of changes, also known as 'hunks.'\n\nThe Expert's completion specifically uses `grep -v ^@`, which excludes the lines starting with '@', and `wc -l` to count the number of differing lines directly. Therefore, the LLM's solution isn't faithful to the task of counting the actual differing lines."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Counts lines in file /workspace/dir1/a.txt ignoring empty lines and lines with spaces only.
LLM's completion: find /workspace/dir1 -name a.txt -exec wc -l {} \; | grep -v ^0$
Expert's completion: awk '!/^[[:space:]]*$/{++x} END{print x}' /workspace/dir1/a.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion searches for the file and counts all lines, not ignoring empty or whitespace-only lines. The use of 'wc -l' counts all lines, and the grep command only filters out output lines that are zero, which is distinct from ignoring empty or whitespace-only lines in the file's content."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a symbolic link in directory "~/newlinks" for each file listed in "/workspace/results.txt"
LLM's completion: xargs -I {} ln -s {} ~/newlinks < /workspace/results.txt
Expert's completion: cat /workspace/results.txt | xargs -I{} ln -s {} ~/newlinks
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions correctly use `xargs` with `ln -s` to create symbolic links in the `~/newlinks` directory for each file listed in `/workspace/results.txt`. The only difference is the omission of `cat`, but this is redundant as `xargs` can read from the file directly. The LLM's completion is therefore faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Delete all hidden files under /workspace
LLM's completion: find /workspace -name '.*' -exec rm -rf {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -name '.*' -delete
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion will delete all hidden files and directories, not just files. The expert's completion restricts the deletion to hidden files only, which is more faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display a dump of "/workspace/dir1/long.txt" as floating point values of double size
LLM's completion: od -d /workspace/dir1/long.txt
Expert's completion: od -t fD /workspace/dir1/long.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `od -d`, which interprets the file as signed decimal shorts, while the correct interpretation for floating point values of double size is `od -t fD`. This specifies 'f' for floating point and 'D' for double precision."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display differences between list of files in /workspace/dir1 and /workspace/dir2.
LLM's completion: diff -r /workspace/dir1 /workspace/dir2
Expert's completion: diff <(ls /workspace/dir1) <(ls /workspace/dir2)
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion, `diff -r /workspace/dir1 /workspace/dir2`, compares the contents of files recursively between the two directories, which is not exactly what the original task asked for. The task was to display differences between the lists of files in the two directories, not the contents of the files themselves. The expert’s translation, `diff <(ls /workspace/dir1) <(ls /workspace/dir2)`, captures the task correctly by listing the files in each directory and then comparing those lists."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the file size of file '/workspace/dir1/sum.c' in bytes
LLM's completion: du -b /workspace/dir1/sum.c
Expert's completion: du -sb /workspace/dir1/sum.c | cut -f1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `du -b`, which measures in bytes on some systems but defaults to blocks on others. The expert's completion uses `du -sb` for a more consistent approach and pipes it to `cut -f1` to specifically extract the size. The LLM's solution may not consistently provide the byte size depending on the environment."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the last slash-separated part of each filename path in /workspace/dir1/file.txt
LLM's completion: basename /workspace/dir1/file.txt
Expert's completion: rev /workspace/dir1/file.txt | cut -d/ -f1 | rev
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion using `basename /workspace/dir1/file.txt` effectively achieves the same result by extracting the last part of a pathname, which corresponds to the filename in this context. The expert's more complex method using `rev`, `cut`, and `rev` again is unnecessary for this task as `basename` directly provides the desired output."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the sizes and filepaths of all files/directories in /workspace directory sorted in descending order of size
LLM's completion: du -sh /workspace/* | sort -hr
Expert's completion: du /workspace -a -h | sort -hr
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `du -sh /workspace/*`, which summarizes the sizes of items in the /workspace directory without showing all individual files. The expert's completion `du /workspace -a -h` lists all files and directories recursively in the /workspace directory, providing detailed sizes before sorting. The LLM's output is less detailed and potentially misses nested files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print percentage of the space used on the /workspace directory.
LLM's completion: df -h /workspace | grep workspace | awk '{print $5}'
Expert's completion: df -k /workspace | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}'
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is generally faithful to the task of printing the percentage of space used on the /workspace directory. Both solutions use `df` to check the disk usage and `awk` to extract the percentage used, which is in the fifth column of the output. \n\nThe main difference is in handling output manipulation:\n- The expert uses `tail -1` to get the last line (which is usually the line containing the information for the requested path), ensuring we get the exact row with the relevant data, especially useful if multiple partitions are listed.\n- The LLM uses `grep workspace` which also aims to filter for the '/workspace' line specifically, which might work under normal circumstances but could be less precise if any line other than the intended one contains the keyword 'workspace'.\n- The `df -h` option in the LLM's solution shows the output in a human-readable format but doesn't affect the task fidelity.\n\nIn regular scenarios, both commands should produce equivalent results, thus the LLM's translation is technically faithful to the task, albeit slightly less precise due to the `grep` usage."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create an empty file "Icon" in workspace/ with a carriage return character in the end of its name.
LLM's completion: touch workspace/Icon$'\r'
Expert's completion: echo $'workspace/Icon\r' | xargs touch
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion `touch workspace/Icon$'\\r'` correctly creates an empty file named 'Icon' with a carriage return character at the end, which matches the intended task in the natural language description. The expert's completion `echo $'workspace/Icon\\r' | xargs touch` achieves the same result but uses a different method. Both solutions are valid and faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Create a symbolc link in the /workspace/dir1 to root folder
LLM's completion: ln -s /workspace/dir /root
Expert's completion: ln /workspace/dir1 -s /
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion attempts to create a symbolic link from '/workspace/dir' to '/root', which is not faithful to the task because it should create a symbolic link in '/workspace/dir1' to the root folder. The expert's translation correctly places the symbolic link in '/workspace/dir1' pointing to the root directory '/'. Furthermore, there are positional errors in both completions regarding options and their order."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display permissions, user, group, and full path for each file in the /workspace directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -printf "%m %u %g %p\n"
Expert's completion: tree /workspace -p -u -g -f
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the `find` command with the `-printf` option to display permissions, user, group, and full path for each file, which correctly retrieves the required information. However, it doesn't handle directory hierarchy formatting as `tree` would. The expert's completion uses the `tree` command, which naturally formats directory trees and provides the specified information using `-p`, `-u`, `-g`, and `-f` for permissions, user, group, and full path, respectively. While both commands return the requested data, they present it differently, with `tree` more accurately matching the hierarchical output asked in the description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for 'hello' case insensitively in all files under /workspace directory tree and show the matched lines with their filenames
LLM's completion: grep -iR "hello" /workspace
Expert's completion: find /workspace -type f -print0  | xargs -0 grep -iH "hello"
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful because it uses `grep -iR`, which recursively searches through all files in the specified directory tree for the string 'hello', case insensitively, and prints the matched lines with filenames. This matches the intended function of the expert's command."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Unpack all *.gz archives in the /workspace directory tree
LLM's completion: find /workspace -type f -name '*.gz' -exec gunzip {} \;
Expert's completion: find /workspace -name '*.gz' -print0 | xargs -0 gunzip
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly finds all `.gz` files in the `/workspace` directory tree and unpacks them using `gunzip`. The use of `-exec gunzip {} \\;` appropriately handles each file and is a faithful translation of the task. The expert's completion uses `-print0` and `xargs -0` for safer handling of filenames with spaces, but both solutions achieve the same goal."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Uncompress "/workspace/archive.tar.gz" and extract the archive to "/backup"
LLM's completion: tar -xzf /workspace/archive.tar.gz -C /backup
Expert's completion: gzip -dc /workspace/archive.tar.gz | tar -xf - -C /backup
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's translation uses the command `tar -xzf`, which works correctly for uncompressing and extracting a `.tar.gz` file directly to the specified directory. This is equivalent to the steps taken by the expert's method, which first decompresses using `gzip -dc` and then extracts using `tar -xf`. Both achieve the same result."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Retrieve only build number of current kernel, ie. #104
LLM's completion: uname -r | cut -d '-' -f 2
Expert's completion: uname -v | grep -o '#[0-9]\+'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion retrieves the part of the kernel release number after the first hyphen, which is not specifically the build number. The expert's completion correctly retrieves the build number using the kernel version string with a regular expression to isolate the build number."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List file information of the full path of command "grep"
LLM's completion: ls -l $(which grep)
Expert's completion: ls -ald `which grep`
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `ls -l $(which grep)` which lists detailed information about the 'grep' command. However, it will not follow symlinks and list the link itself. The expert's completion `ls -ald \x1b which grep \x1b` includes the `-a` option, which ensures hidden files would be included if relevant, and `-d` to avoid descending into directories if 'grep' was given as a directory path. The LLM's completion might not behave as intended if 'grep' ends up being a directory. Thus, the LLM's completion is not fully faithful to the subtle requirements of the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Extract host name part from "http://www.google.com"
LLM's completion: echo "http://www.google.com" | sed 's/^\(.*\)\/\(.*\)$/\1/' | sed 's/^.*:\/\///'
Expert's completion: echo "http://www.google.com" | cut -d'/' -f3
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion first attempts to remove everything after the last slash with the first `sed` command, which is incorrect. Its second `sed` command attempts to remove the initial protocol part, which could work in part but is overly complex for the task. The expert's completion uses `cut` to directly extract the host part, which is simpler and more accurate for this specific task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List environment variables and their values, escaping all semicolons with a backslash.
LLM's completion: printenv | sed 's/;/\\;/g'
Expert's completion: env | sed 's/;/\\;/g'
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `printenv`, which is functionally equivalent to `env` for listing environment variables. Both then use `sed` to replace semicolons with escaped semicolons, which satisfies the requirement of escaping semicolons. Hence, the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Displays a tree of all process alongside their command line arguments.
LLM's completion: pstree -p -a
Expert's completion: pstree -a
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion `pstree -p -a` includes both the `-a` option for command line arguments and the `-p` option for displaying process IDs, which doesn't alter its faithfulness to the task. Both commands meet the requirement to display command line arguments, thus it is faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print numbers 1 through 10 separated by ":"
LLM's completion: seq -s ":" 1 10
Expert's completion: yes | head -n10 | grep -n . | cut -d: -f1 | paste -sd:
is_faithful=True explanation='The LLM\'s completion using `seq -s ":" 1 10` directly prints numbers 1 through 10 separated by colons, which matches the task description perfectly. It is more concise than the expert\'s approach, and correctly fulfills the requirement.'
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: print all readline bindings
LLM's completion: bind -p
Expert's completion: bind -P
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion `bind -p` lists all current readline keybindings, including default and custom. However, the expert's completion `bind -P` specifically lists only non-default (custom) bindings. While similar, they fulfill slightly different purposes."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: list names of bind functions containing "p"
LLM's completion: bind -P | grep p
Expert's completion: bind -l | grep p
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `bind -P` which lists the names and current bindings of all functions, not just their names. The expert's completion `bind -l` correctly lists all function names, and then pipes this through `grep p` to filter by the letter 'p'. The LLM's translation doesn't faithfully execute the specified task of listing *names* containing 'p'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Save first IP address of domain 'google.com' in 'address' variable and display it
LLM's completion: address=$(dig +short google.com | head -n 1); echo $address
Expert's completion: address=$(dig +short google.com | grep -E '^[0-9.]+$' | head -n 1) && echo $address
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion effectively captures the task requirements by using `dig +short google.com` to obtain the IP addresses and `head -n 1` to select the first one. It then displays the IP address with `echo $address`. The expert's completion adds a `grep` to filter valid IP addresses, however, since 'dig +short' generally returns only valid addresses, the LLM's version remains faithful to the core task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove all characters except ";" and digits from the string "  Hello world;876	  "
LLM's completion: echo '  Hello world;876	  ' | sed 's/[^0-9;]/g'
Expert's completion: echo '  Hello world;876	  ' | tr -cd ';0-9'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `sed` with the command 's/[^0-9;]/g', which is incorrect for the specified task. The 's/…/…/g' syntax in `sed` is for substitution, and it does not directly perform character filtering. Consequently, the LLM's version does not remove unwanted characters. \n\nIn contrast, the expert's completion uses `tr -cd ';0-9'`, which correctly removes all characters except ';' and digits from the input, as required by the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Remove leading and trailing spaces or tabs from "  Hello world!	  "
LLM's completion: echo "  Hello world!	  " | sed 's/^[ \t]*//;s/[ \t]*$//'
Expert's completion: echo '  Hello world!	  ' | sed -e 's/^[ \t]*//' | sed -e 's/[ \t]*$//'
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses a single `sed` command with multiple expressions separated by a semicolon to remove leading and trailing spaces or tabs, which is a more concise equivalent to the expert's completion. Both solutions achieve the task correctly by stripping spaces and tabs from the beginning and end of the string."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print source of the file system containing current working directory.
LLM's completion: df -T | awk 'NR==2 {print $2}'
Expert's completion: df . | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `df -T | awk 'NR==2 {print $2}'`, which lists all filesystems in a tabular format and attempts to print the type of the second filesystem listed. This approach does not specifically target the current working directory. The expert’s solution `df . | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'` specifically targets the current working directory by using `df .` to print information about the filesystem containing it, then parses that output to print the source of that filesystem. Therefore, the LLM's completion is not faithful to the specific task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all variables (names only) with names containing "H".
LLM's completion: env | grep -i H | cut -d'=' -f1
Expert's completion: env | awk -F= '{if($1 ~ /H/) print $1}'
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion faithfully lists environment variable names containing 'H' by using `grep -i H` to filter and `cut -d'=' -f1` to isolate the name part. This is functionally equivalent to the expert's use of `awk` to match and print variable names containing 'H'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print a list of unique users who are logged in
LLM's completion: who | awk '{print $1}' | sort -u
Expert's completion: who | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort | uniq
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `who` to list currently logged-in users, `awk` to extract the first field (usernames), and `sort -u` to sort and remove duplicates. This is similar to the expert's version, which uses `cut` and `uniq`. Both achieve the task of listing unique users."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: ping 192.168.1.1
LLM's completion: ping -c 4 192.168.1.1
Expert's completion: ping -w 1 192.168.1.1
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion and the Expert's completion are faithful because they execute the command 'ping 192.168.1.1'. The LLM adds '-c 4', which limits the pings to 4 packets, and the Expert adds '-w 1', which sets a timeout of 1 second. However, both accomplish the primary task of 'ping 192.168.1.1'."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print a line of 99 '=' characters
LLM's completion: yes -n 1 | head -c 99 | tr '\n' '='
Expert's completion: seq -s= 100|tr -d '[:digit:]'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not correctly print '=' characters. It uses `yes` to generate 'y' characters, changes them to '=', and limits the output to 99 characters, making the approach inefficient and incorrect. The expert's solution correctly generates 99 '=' signs using `seq` with a delimiter, eliminating digits with `tr`."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Displays calendar of a previous, current and next month for December of 2120 year.
LLM's completion: cal -3 -y 2120
Expert's completion: cal -3 12 2120
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-3` to display the previous, current, and next months, and `-y 2120` specifies the year, which covers December 2120 and neighboring months. This achieves the same result as the expert's completion, which explicitly specifies the month `12` for December."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Calculate the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 10
LLM's completion: awk 'BEGIN {sum=0; for(i=1;i<=10;i++) sum+=i; print sum}'
Expert's completion: seq 10 | jq -s 'add'
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions correctly calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10. The LLM uses 'awk' to iterate and sum the numbers, while the expert uses 'seq' and 'jq' to achieve the same goal. Both methods are valid solutions to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of files and directories in the entire testbed directory
LLM's completion: find testbed -type f -o -type d | wc -l
Expert's completion: find /testbed | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="Both solutions aim to count files and directories. The LLM's version explicitly specifies types for files and directories, whereas the expert's solution relies on the implicit behavior of `find` to include both. Both commands are functionally equivalent in this context, so the LLM's completion is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the number of python files in the testbed directory.
LLM's completion: find testbed -name '*.py' | wc -l
Expert's completion: find testbed -type f -name "*.py" | wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task. It uses the `find` command to search for files in the `testbed` directory with names ending in `.py`, and then pipes the result to `wc -l` to count them. Although it doesn't explicitly specify `-type f`, which ensures only files (not directories) are counted, it generally defaults to finding files, making the solution functionally correct in most scenarios."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Sort the lines of textfile1.txt in reverse alphabetical order and save the result to a new file
LLM's completion: sort -r textfile1.txt > sorted_file.txt
Expert's completion: sort -r /testbed/dir1/textfile1.txt > /testbed/dir1/textfile1_reverse_sorted.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion correctly utilizes the `sort -r` command to sort the lines of 'textfile1.txt' in reverse order and redirects the output to a new file 'sorted_file.txt'. While the file paths differ, the core operation described by the natural language instruction is accurately represented in both completions."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for all files containing the word 'Shell' in testbed.
LLM's completion: find testbed -type f -exec grep -i 'Shell' {} \;
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec grep -l 'Shell' {} +
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `-i`, which makes the search case-insensitive, not specified in the task. It also lacks `-l`, which should list filenames containing the word 'Shell', not their contents. Additionally, it doesn't end the `find` command with `+`, missing a performance optimization in handling files."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find all symbolic links in the testbed directory.
LLM's completion: find testbed -type l
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type l
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion is faithful to the task as both use the `find` command to search for symbolic links (`-type l`) in the `testbed` directory. The only difference is that the expert's version uses an absolute path, while the LLM's uses a relative path. Both fulfill the requirement of finding symbolic links in the testbed directory as understood from the description."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Get the total size of all files in testbed/ and save it to total_size.txt
LLM's completion: find testbed/ -type f | xargs du -ch | grep total$ | awk '{print $1}' > total_size.txt
Expert's completion: du -sh testbed/ | awk '{print $1}' > total_size.txt
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` and `xargs du -ch` to list detailed sizes for each file, summing it with `grep total$`. However, it captures the summed size of all files with `awk`, which can be more complex than necessary. The expert's solution simply uses `du -sh testbed/` which directly provides the total size in a more straightforward and efficient manner."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all files in the directory /testbed/dir1 and sort them by size in human-readable format
LLM's completion: ls -lhS /testbed/dir1 | sort -k 5
Expert's completion: ls -lhS /testbed/dir1
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion adds an unnecessary `sort` command, which is not required since `ls -lhS` already sorts the files by size in human-readable format. The expert's completion (`ls -lhS /testbed/dir1`) accurately fulfills the task without redundant steps."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Count the number of lines in files under the directory /testbed/dir2.
LLM's completion: find /testbed/dir2 -type f -exec wc -l {} \; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'
Expert's completion: grep -rl . /testbed/dir2 | xargs wc -l
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's completion and the expert's completion achieve the task of counting the number of lines in files under the directory /testbed/dir2.\n\nLLM's completion: \n- Uses `find` to locate files (`-type f`) and applies `wc -l` to each file, then sums the line counts using `awk`.\n\nExpert's completion: \n- Uses `grep -rl` to list files and counts lines using `wc -l` through `xargs`.\n\nBoth methods correctly perform the line counting task and sum the total, thus the LLM's completion is faithful."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the name and size of the 3 largest files in the directory /testbed/dir3
LLM's completion: du -h --max-depth=1 /testbed/dir3 | sort -hr | head -n 3
Expert's completion: find /testbed/dir3 -type f -exec ls -lhS {} + | sort -rh -k5 | head -n 3
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `du` to calculate directory sizes rather than file sizes, which doesn't fulfill the task of listing the 3 largest files. The expert's completion correctly uses `find` and `ls` to list files and sort them by size."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Find all files modified in the last 2 hours and compress them into a tarball named archive.tar.gz in the directory /testbed
LLM's completion: find /testbed -mmin -120 -exec tar -czvf archive.tar.gz {} +
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -mmin -120 -print0 | xargs -0 tar -czf /testbed/archive.tar.gz
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion does not correctly handle the creation of the tarball. It uses `-exec` which adds each file separately to `tar`, but it doesn't properly form the tarball `archive.tar.gz` with all found files in one go. It misses handling paths containing spaces and may not accurately place the tarball in the correct directory, unlike the expert's method which uses `xargs` with `-0` to safely handle all files together without issues due to space or special characters in filenames."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: List all subdirectories of /testbed that are not named subdir1
LLM's completion: find /testbed -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d ! -name subdir1
Expert's completion: ls -d /testbed/*/ | grep -v /subdir1/
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and expert's solutions achieve the task of listing subdirectories in `/testbed` that are not named `subdir1`. \n\nThe LLM uses `find`, specifying `-mindepth 1` and `-maxdepth 1` to ensure only immediate subdirectories are considered, and `-type d` to filter directories while excluding `subdir1` with `! -name subdir1`.\n\nThe expert solution uses `ls -d` to list directories and `grep` to filter out any directory named `subdir1`. \n\nBoth methods are valid and achieve the same result, making the LLM's completion faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for all files that contain the string 'text file' under the directory /testbed
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec grep -l "text file" {} \;
Expert's completion: grep -r 'text file' /testbed
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's completions correctly fulfill the task of searching for files containing the string 'text file' under the directory /testbed. The LLM's solution uses 'find' combined with 'grep', while the expert uses 'grep -r'. Both approaches are valid and will achieve the desired result. The LLM's method is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Compute the MD5 hash of all files under the directory /testbed and store them in a file named hashes.txt in the same directory
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f | xargs md5sum > /testbed/hashes.txt
Expert's completion: find /testbed -type f -exec md5sum {} + > /testbed/hashes.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="Both the LLM's and the expert's solutions achieve the task effectively. They each find all files in the directory and compute their MD5 hashes, storing the results in `hashes.txt`. The difference is in the method of passing files to `md5sum`. The LLM solution uses `xargs` while the expert uses `-exec`, but both are valid approaches. Therefore, the LLM's response is faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the last 10 lines of the file /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt
LLM's completion: cat /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt | tail -n 10
Expert's completion: tail -n 10 /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion achieves the same result as the expert's completion by using `cat` to output the file and then piping it into `tail -n 10`. While it's slightly less efficient, as it uses an extra command, it is still functionally equivalent and faithful to the task of printing the last 10 lines of the file."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Print the line number and contents of all lines containing the string 'value3' in the file /testbed/dir1/subdir1/jsonfile1.json
LLM's completion: cat /testbed/dir1/subdir1/jsonfile1.json | grep -n value3
Expert's completion: grep -n 'value3' /testbed/dir1/subdir1/jsonfile1.json
is_faithful=True explanation="The LLM's completion and the expert's completion both achieve the same task. They both utilize `grep -n` to print line numbers and contents of lines containing 'value3'. While the LLM uses `cat` in conjunction with `grep`, which is not necessary, the outcome is still faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Search for all the files in /testbed directory and its subdirectories that contain the word 'Hello' and replace it with 'Hi' in-place.
LLM's completion: find /testbed -type f | xargs sed -i 's/Hello/Hi/g'
Expert's completion: grep -rl "Hello" /testbed | xargs sed -i 's/Hello/Hi/g'
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses `find` to list all files, whereas the task specifically requests searching for files containing 'Hello'. The expert's uses `grep -rl` to correctly find files containing 'Hello', making it faithful to the task."
----------------------------------------
Natural Language Description: Display the contents of textfile3.txt and textfile4.txt side by side, with line numbers and a separator between them.
LLM's completion: paste -d '|' -s textfile3.txt textfile4.txt
Expert's completion: paste <(nl /testbed/dir3/subdir1/subsubdir1/textfile3.txt) <(nl /testbed/dir1/subdir1/textfile4.txt)
is_faithful=False explanation="The LLM's completion uses the command `paste -d '|' -s`, which horizontally combines the contents of `textfile3.txt` and `textfile4.txt` with a `|` separator. However, it doesn't include line numbers. Additionally, the `-s` flag serially pastes the files, but the requirement was to show them side by side, likely implying no `-s`. The expert's completion uses `nl` to number lines and redirects both through `paste`, achieving the requested format."
